# 3D Prompt Collection

A presentation-order collection of prompts. Each entry includes only the prompt title and the prompt text. Prompts are collapsed so the page stays browsable on GitHub; expand any title to copy the prompt.

## Visual dashboard

Explore [Worlds — Prompt Atlas](https://worlds-prompt-atlas.meetpandya.chatgpt.site), the public dashboard for this collection. Each of the 63 prompts has four ImageGen conceptual previews. Browse by section, search the collection, jump to any prompt, read and copy its complete text, or open a sample image full screen.

### Run locally

Use Node.js 22.12 or later:

```sh
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Create and preview the production build:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The dashboard reads the original prompt content directly from `prompts.json`. Preview assets are stored in `public/previews/`; each WebP sheet contains four distinct compositions, and `src/image-sizes.json` records the native dimensions used to display each frame. `.openai/hosting.json` identifies the published Sites project.

## Sections

### Embed under a catalogue path

The default build still runs at `/`. Vite's base sets all script, favicon, and
preview URLs. To embed this dashboard in a catalogue, build with:

```sh
VITE_COLLECTIONS_URL=/prompts npm run build -- --base=/prompts/peter-gostev-3d-prompt-collection-dashboard/
```

In PowerShell, set `$env:VITE_COLLECTIONS_URL='/prompts'` before running the build.
Leave that variable unset for a standalone deployment. It adds an All collections
link without changing the dashboard design or its hash-based prompt links
(`…/#prompt-04`). Serve the build at the same base path, including on refresh.
Keep the 63 original WebP sheets and `src/image-sizes.json` together: `Preview.jsx`
uses their native dimensions and an SVG viewBox/clip path to isolate each of the
four compositions. Do not resize or split the sheets.

<summary><strong>01. Billion-Piece Manhattan - The Entire Island, Alive</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js environment of the ENTIRE island of Manhattan, alive, from the Battery to Inwood, rendered as one continuous explorable object at golden hour. The spectacle is total scale plus continuous zoom: the first frame shows the whole island at once like the world's most detailed aerial photograph, and the camera can then dive seamlessly from that god view down toward street level where traffic moves, ferries cross and rooftop water towers catch the sun. This must not be a single district, a skyline billboard, a low-poly slab city or a fog-hidden partial model. It is the complete island.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: tens of thousands of buildings each with a real footprint, massing and roofline; the true street grid with avenues and cross streets; Central Park as a complete green world; every major bridge; piers, highways, stadiums, cemeteries, tank farms of rooftop water towers, and rivers full of traffic. Achieve this through brutal instancing discipline, procedural building generation, merged districts and nested LOD, not through raw counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external data files, images or models - approximate the real geography convincingly from knowledge.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE WHOLE ISLAND IN ONE IMPOSSIBLE IMAGE
- Open on the complete island from high above the southwest, sun low over New Jersey: the full length of Manhattan receding to the north, Downtown and Midtown clusters blazing with lit glass, Central Park a perfect green rectangle, the Hudson and East rivers wrapping it in gold-flecked water, all bridges visible.
- The island must read as dense and real: the famous skyline silhouettes recognizable at a glance (One World Trade, Empire State, Chrysler, the Midtown supertalls, the Flatiron wedge), the street grid etched in shadow, ferry wakes stitching the rivers.
- The frame is full edge to edge: Brooklyn and Queens rooftops fading into haze east, New Jersey west, the harbor and a hint of the Statue of Liberty south.
- No menus, titles or reveals. The island is simply there, complete.

#### THE ZOOM IS THE SPECTACLE
- Design the entire experience around one continuous zoom range with no loading seams and no popping that breaks belief: from whole-island orbit, through district level where individual towers separate, down to neighborhood level where streets carry visible moving traffic, water towers and rooftop details resolve, and window-scale texture appears on the nearest buildings.
- At the closest tier, the nearest few blocks must genuinely reward inspection: cornices, fire escapes, rooftop HVAC and water towers, taxi streams, walk lights implied by crowd pulses, tree pits, awnings.
- Transitions between LOD tiers must be smoothly cross-faded or geo-morphed. The viewer should feel one coherent world, not tiles swapping.

#### THE ISLAND, HONESTLY BUILT
- Respect the real macro-geography: the tapering southern tip, the grid rotating north of the Village, Broadway cutting its diagonal, Central Park's exact proportion mid-island, the Harlem street rhythm, the ridge and green of the north end, the widening and narrowing of the island.
- Landmark set with true silhouettes and placements: One World Trade and the Downtown cluster; the Brooklyn, Manhattan and Williamsburg bridges; the Flatiron; Empire State; Chrysler; Grand Central's low mass among towers; the Midtown supertall row; the UN slab on the East River; the Met in the park edge; the George Washington Bridge at the top of the island.
- Everything else is procedurally generated but honest: block-correct building heights by district, tenement rows, avenue canyons, piers and the West Side Highway, stuyvesant-style superblocks, project towers uptown, and green pockets (Washington Square, Bryant Park, Riverside strip).
- Central Park is a complete sub-world: reservoir, lakes, meadows, tree masses, paths, ballfields, all readable from altitude and pleasant at mid-zoom.

#### A CITY THAT IS VISIBLY ALIVE AT EVERY SCALE
- Rivers: ferries, barges and tour boats moving with wakes; helicopters tracking the shoreline; the harbor busy to the south.
- Streets: avenue-scale traffic flows as animated streams with taxi-yellow concentration, red brake ripples and headlight sparkle in shaded canyons; crosstown streets pulse differently from avenues.
- Air and light: sun glinting and sliding across thousands of glass faces as the camera orbits, cloud shadows crossing districts, contrails, a jet on approach in the distance, birds over the park.
- Detail-tier life: at close zoom, steam from street grates, rooftop flags, moving elevated traffic on the FDR and West Side Highway.

#### LIGHT AND MATERIAL
- Golden hour as default: long shadows etching the grid, warm masonry versus cool glass, the two rivers as sheets of moving glitter, park foliage deep and saturated.
- Materials must vary by district and era: dark glass supertalls, green-roofed pre-war stone, red-brick tenements, white terracotta classics, weathered piers.
- Windows carry believable variation: sun mirrors, interior warmth beginning to show in shadowed faces, no two towers identical.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Orbit, pan and zoom active immediately with beautifully tuned inertia across the whole zoom range; one reset returns to the hero island view.
- Camera presets: full-island hero; Downtown harbor orbit; Midtown canyon dive; Central Park overview; East River bridge sweep; George Washington Bridge north view back down the island.
- Compact controls only: light (golden hour / clear noon / dusk with the city lighting up window by window), river and street traffic density, and photo mode.
- Dusk mode is a required showpiece: thousands of windows igniting progressively, bridge necklaces lighting, streams of headlights.

#### PERFORMANCE AS A FIRST-CLASS FEATURE
- This prompt lives or dies on LOD engineering: merged district meshes at far tier, instanced building archetypes with per-instance variation at mid tier, bespoke detailed blocks streaming in near the camera, imposters for the far tier of the opposite end of the island.
- Traffic, boats and window lights are instanced systems with LOD behavior of their own.
- Quality selector degrades far window variation, traffic density and reflections before ever degrading island completeness or landmark silhouettes.
- Must remain smooth on a modern laptop through the entire zoom range; clamp devicePixelRatio to 2; no memory explosions. The wow is the whole island, alive, in one unbroken piece.

<summary><strong>02. Ancient Rome Voxel City Centre Simulation Spec</strong></summary>

```text
#### OBJECTIVE

Create a breathtaking, high-definition voxel-art simulation of the entire Ancient Roman City Centre, anchored by a massive, detailed Colosseum. The scene must be generated procedurally, featuring topography, a dense cityscape, and intelligent layout planning.

#### USER CONTROLS

- **Camera:** "God-mode" orbit controls (Left-click rotate, Right-click pan, Scroll zoom).
- **Shortcuts:**
  - **[R]** Re-centre on Colosseum.
  - **[F]** Flyover mode (constant rotation around the city).
  - **[T]** Toggle Time of Day (Day/Sunset).

#### WORLD GENERATION & GEOLOGY (Requirement: Solid & Natural)

- **Topography:** Generate a terrain mesh representing the "Seven Hills of Rome" (rolling elevation changes) and the Tiber River cutting through the edge of the map.
- **Solid Ground:** Ensure the floor is a continuous, solid voxel mesh (no gaps/voids). Use varied palettes for the ground: cobblestone for streets, grassy banks for hills, and dirt for the arena floor.
- **Vegetation:** Procedurally scatter Roman vegetation: Italian Cypress trees (tall/thin), Umbrella Pines (high canopy), and olive shrubs on the hillsides to frame the architecture.

#### ARCHITECTURAL SCOPE (Requirement: High Definition & Variety)

#### The Colosseum (Centerpiece)

- High-resolution voxel scale (smaller voxels for finer detail).
- **Internal details:** Cavea (seating tiers), the Hypogeum (exposed underground maze), and the Velarium (awning structure).
- **Population:** Dense crowds (colored voxel clusters) and Gladiators battling in the center.

#### The City Centre (The Forum & Surroundings)

- Surrounding the Colosseum, generate a dense array of contemporary structures.
- **Landmarks:** Include abstract representations of the Arch of Constantine, the Temple of Venus and Roma, and the Basilicas.
- **Infrastructure:** Aqueducts spanning the horizon, colonnades, and a distant Circus Maximus track if render budget allows.
- **Residential:** Dense insulae (apartment blocks) with terracotta roofs filling the gaps between major monuments.

#### CITY PLANNING LOGIC (Requirement: No Overlap)

- **Grid & Collision:** Implement a bounding-box allocation system. Before placing a building, check the grid to ensure no overlap with existing geometry.
- **Zoning:**
  - **Zone A (Center):** Colosseum (Fixed position).
  - **Zone B (Forum):** High-density Temples and Basilicas.
  - **Zone C (Outskirts):** Residential and Hills.
- **Roads:** Generate clear "Cardo" and "Decumanus" style stone pathways connecting major buildings; buildings must snap to these paths.

#### VISUAL FIDELITY

- **Atmosphere:** Warm, Mediterranean lighting.
- **Water:** The Tiber River must feature a reflective or semi-transparent blue voxel material.
- **Palette:** Use a rich, historical palette: Travertine (creamy white), Porphyry (purple/red), Terracotta (orange/brown), Marble (white/grey), and Gold accents for temple roofs.
- **Shadows:** Approximate ambient occlusion or directional lighting to give depth to the voxel blocks.

#### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- **Deliverable:** Provide the full implementation.
- **Offline only:** All code/assets embedded. NO external imports/CDNs.
- **Performance:** Target >= 55 FPS.
- **Crucial:** Use InstancedMesh (Three.js concept or WebGL equivalent) for all voxels. Do NOT create individual geometry for every block. Merge geometries where possible.
- Use a shared texture atlas generated programmatically (Canvas API) for voxel colors to reduce draw calls.

#### IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS

- **Module Resolution:** Use `<script type="importmap">` for any Three.js logic, mapping `"three"` to a minified, base64-encoded inline version OR write raw WebGL2 if confident.
- **Scope Safety:** Use const/let, avoid global namespace pollution.
- **Memory:** Dispose of geometries/materials if regenerating.
- **Code Quality:** Robust error handling. If a procedural placement fails 10 times, skip that building to prevent infinite loops.

#### FINAL OUTPUT INSTRUCTION

Generate the full output now. Ensure the scale feels "Grand" and the resolution is high enough that the Colosseum looks curved rather than square.

<summary><strong>03. The Seven Wonders - One Horizon</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js world in which all Seven Wonders of the Ancient World stand together, restored and alive, along one continuous sunlit coastline - an image that has never existed and can only exist here. The camera sails a grand bay: the Lighthouse of Alexandria guards the harbor mouth; the Colossus of Rhodes stands over the next inlet; the Great Pyramid of Giza rises inland on a golden plain; the Hanging Gardens of Babylon terrace down to the water in cascading green; the Temple of Artemis gleams in its precinct; the Statue of Zeus is glimpsed enthroned through the doors of its own temple; and the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus crowns a headland. This must not be a museum of scattered models on flat ground, a diorama with toy scale, or a dark stylized montage. It is one coherent, breathing ancient Mediterranean world at true relative scale.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: column flutes, gilded statues, painted friezes, terraced plantings, harbor chains, rigging, roof tiles, market awnings, processional roads and thousands of inhabitants. Achieve it with extreme visible detail, instancing and nested LOD, not raw counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - SEVEN WONDERS, ONE HORIZON
- Open from the deck-height of a ship entering the bay in late-morning sun: the Pharos towering close on one side with its smoke and mirror flashing, the Colossus visible across the water, and at least four other wonders readable along the receding coastline, each unmistakable by silhouette alone.
- The bay is alive: merchant ships under sail, oared galleys, fishing boats, gulls, sparkling water and wakes. The shore is alive: harbors, warehouses, processions, caravans moving between the wonders on a coastal road.
- True relative scale is a core spectacle: the Pyramid must dwarf everything as a mountain of geometry; the Pharos and Colossus read as astonishing but human-made; the temples are vast yet approachable. The viewer should visibly FEEL the size ranking.
- Bright Mediterranean light, saturated sea, painted architecture. No menus, titles or reveals.

#### EACH WONDER, DONE JUSTICE
- Pharos of Alexandria: three tapering tiers, the flame chamber with a polished mirror flashing periodically, spiral ramp traffic of fuel donkeys, statues at the corners, waves breaking on its mole.
- Colossus of Rhodes: a bronze sun-god standing beside (not straddling) the harbor entrance on a great pedestal, sun blazing off the bronze, ships passing beneath his gaze, a radiate crown catching light.
- Great Pyramid of Giza: polished white casing intact with a gilded capstone, mirror-flat faces flashing the sun, a processional causeway, sphinx and satellite pyramids suggested, heat shimmer on the plain.
- Hanging Gardens of Babylon: stepped terraces overflowing with instanced vegetation, visible water-lifting screws and channels glinting as they turn, waterfalls between levels, gardeners moving among palms.
- Temple of Artemis: a forest of slender columns with painted capitals, votive smoke, pilgrims, market of silver trinkets at its steps.
- Statue of Zeus at Olympia: inside its temple with the great doors open toward the sea road, the seated god in gold and ivory glimpsed glowing in shadowed interior light - a composed reveal through columns that rewards approaching the doorway.
- Mausoleum at Halicarnassus: the stepped roof and chariot finial on its headland, sculpted friezes readable up close, cypress avenue approaching.

#### ONE WORLD, NOT SEVEN EXHIBITS
- Stitch the wonders with living connective tissue: a coastal road carrying caravans of camels and carts, way-stations, aqueduct fragments, fishing villages, olive groves and vineyards on the slopes, herds, and a shared sea full of traffic moving between harbors.
- Each wonder generates its own activity system: pilgrim queues at Artemis and Zeus, construction-free (all complete and maintained - crews polish and garden rather than build), harbor loading at Pharos and Rhodes, funerary procession at the Mausoleum, priests on the Gardens' terraces.
- Populations are autonomous and purposeful: walking, sailing, loading, worshipping, trading. No frozen mannequins.

#### LIGHT, MATERIAL AND DYNAMISM
- Materials carry the spectacle: blinding white marble, painted friezes in ochre, blue and red, gilded bronze, polished limestone casing, deep green terraces, turquoise shallows over sand.
- The sun's low-morning angle rakes everything; the Pharos mirror and Pyramid faces throw periodic flashes; the Colossus burns like a candle at certain camera angles - stage these alignments deliberately.
- Constant gentle dynamism: sails filling, waterwheels and screws turning, smoke columns, banners, birds, waves and wakes, cloth awnings breathing.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Default experience: a slow, majestic sail-by camera path along the whole coast that the viewer can pause, scrub and detach from at any moment into free orbit; a reset returns to the ship's-deck hero start.
- Presets: one perfect composition per wonder plus the full-coast aerial that shows all seven at once - the impossible postcard.
- Compact controls: time of light (morning / golden evening / torch-lit dusk with the Pharos flame dominant), sea and land activity density, sail-by speed, photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Bespoke maximum detail on whichever wonder is nearest the camera, streaming detail budgets as the sail-by progresses; silhouette-perfect distant wonders at all times - the seven must NEVER pop or vanish.
- Instanced vegetation, crowds, ships, columns and friezes; merged terrain and far architecture; LOD tuned so the full-coast view stays crisp.
- Quality selector reduces crowd density, vegetation and reflections before ever sacrificing wonder silhouettes or material splendor.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the greatest hits of the ancient world, finally in one frame, alive.

<summary><strong>04. One Riverbank, Two Thousand Years</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of one fixed stretch of the Thames riverbank in London, watched from the same camera position across two thousand years, driven by one grand time slider. Every position of the slider is a complete, living, richly detailed world; dragging it morphs the city through history: Roman Londinium's timber wharf, the medieval city crammed onto Old London Bridge, the Great Fire glowing at night, the Victorian forest of masts and steam, the Blitz's searchlights, and today's glass skyline. This must not be a slideshow of static dioramas, a fade between five images, or a sparse stage set. It is one continuous place breathing across centuries, with the river as the only constant.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces in EVERY era: timber joints, rigging, brick chimneys, market stalls, cranes, buses, and thousands of inhabitants living each period. Achieve it with instancing, era-streaming and nested LOD, not raw counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - TODAY, THEN THE SLIDER
- Open on the present day, fully alive: the river bend with a recognizable modern composition (a great bridge, the dome of St Paul's holding its ancient ground among glass towers), boats, buses, crowds on the embankment, afternoon light on the water.
- The time slider is immediately visible as an elegant timeline along the bottom, marked with era labels and small icons. It is the single hero control and invites dragging within seconds.
- No menus, titles or reveals; the present-day world must already reward exploration before the slider is touched.

#### THE ERAS - SIX COMPLETE WORLDS
- Roman, around AD 100: timber quay and warehouses, a bridge of boats or early timber bridge, red-roofed bathhouse and forum on the low hill, galleys unloading amphorae, legionaries, mud, smoke, geese.
- Medieval, around 1400: Old London Bridge crowded with tall houses and its chapel, water wheels roaring between the piers, church spires beyond, timber-framed riverfront, ferrymen, markets, laundry, pigs in lanes.
- The Great Fire, September 1666, night: the city alight upriver, a wall of orange glow and sparks against the dark, silhouetted fleeing boats loaded with belongings, firelight dancing on the water, St Paul's (old, gothic) burning on the skyline. Terrifying and beautiful, but rendered bright and readable, never murky.
- Victorian, around 1850: a forest of masts and steam funnels, warehouses with cranes swinging cargo, the new stone bridges, horse traffic, gaslights, coal smoke haze golden in low sun, mudlarks on the foreshore.
- The Blitz, 1940, night: searchlight beams sweeping, barrage balloons silver overhead, the skyline dark except for fire glows and the famous silhouette of St Paul's dome standing amid smoke, tracer arcs distant, river reflecting it all. Handle with grandeur and restraint - no gore, the drama is light and survival.
- Today: the same bend with its modern icons, tour boats, joggers, buskers, glass towers, the surviving old buildings visibly the same structures the viewer watched exist in earlier eras.

#### CONTINUITY IS THE MAGIC
- Anchor objects must persist and visibly evolve so the morphing feels like one place aging: the river bend and foreshore; one church that grows from stone chapel to gothic spire to Wren dome; one street line that never moves; a corner tavern that is a Roman inn, a medieval alehouse, a Victorian pub and a modern pub with the same footprint.
- When the slider moves, buildings must not simply crossfade: they grow, are re-clad, burn, are rebuilt - staged as fast, readable transformations with scaffolding-free elegance (rising from footprints, roofs assembling, styles re-skinning) so scrubbing back and forth is itself a spectacle.
- The river always flows; boats of the correct era always move on it; birds persist across all time.

#### EVERY ERA FULLY ALIVE
- Each era carries its own autonomous population with correct dress, vehicles and routines: unloading, trading, fleeing, promenading, commuting. Density comparable to the best living-city scenes, never a sparse stage.
- Each era has signature motion: Roman oars and cranes, medieval water wheels, 1666 flames and ember drift, Victorian steam and swinging cargo, Blitz searchlights and balloons, modern traffic and rowing eights.
- Sound-free visual storytelling: readable vignettes in every era rewarding zoom (a Roman merchant arguing over an amphora, a 1666 family loading a boat with a birdcage, a Victorian crane lowering a piano, a modern couple photographing the same view the viewer occupies).

#### LIGHT AND MATERIAL
- Each era gets a distinct, gorgeous lighting signature as listed above; transitions in time also transition light smoothly (scrubbing from 1850 afternoon into 1940 night is a cinematic event).
- Materials evolve honestly: timber, wattle, stone, brick, iron, concrete, glass - weathered and believable at close range in every period.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- The camera holds one privileged bankside position by default but supports orbit, pan and zoom within a generous bubble, plus presets: foreshore level, bridge level, rooftop level, and a high aerial that makes each era's full extent readable.
- The time slider supports both snapping to era labels and free scrubbing between them with interpolated transformation states.
- Compact secondary controls only: activity density, a small "era facts" toggle OFF by default, photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Stream era content intelligently: the active era at full fidelity, adjacent eras pre-warmed for instant scrubbing, distant eras unloaded; shared geology, river and anchor objects always resident.
- Instanced crowds, boats, buildings and props per era; merged distant skylines; LOD discipline throughout.
- Quality selector reduces population and far detail before ever sacrificing transformation smoothness or era completeness.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: two thousand years of one riverbank, held in the hand.

<summary><strong>05. Billion-Piece Paris - Eiffel Tower and the Entire Living Vista</strong></summary>

```text
Create an unprecedented, museum-quality Three.js environment of the Eiffel Tower and its complete Paris setting, rendered with such staggering density and care that the first frame feels impossible: the Iron Lady fully articulated from footings to antenna, the Champ de Mars stretching behind it, the Seine, Pont d'Iena, Trocadero gardens and fountains, elegant avenues, rooftops, trees, river boats, visitors and traffic all existing at once as a living, explorable world. This must not be an isolated tower, a sparse diorama, a generic skyline, an arcade challenge or a simple postcard with a few props. It is a complete Paris landmark environment whose craftsmanship makes the viewer immediately stop and inspect it.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: lattice members, rivets, stairways, elevator machinery, lamps, balustrades, roof dormers, paving stones, trimmed hedges, cafe tables, boats, figures, street furniture, flowers, reflections and moving life. Achieve this through extreme visible detail, intelligent instancing, merged geometry, procedural variation and distance-aware density, not by creating an unusable literal billion draw calls. Make every close camera position reveal new workmanship while the hero view stays clean, iconic and instantly understandable in a fraction of a second.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate geometry, materials, textures, lighting, people, water, vehicles, foliage and animation procedurally; do not rely on external image assets or downloaded models. A finely crafted micro-block or micro-voxel construction language is welcome for buildings, foliage, paving and structural embellishment, provided the tower remains faithful, elegant and unmistakably wrought iron rather than a chunky toy silhouette.

#### FIRST FRAME - PARIS IN ONE ASTONISHING IMAGE
- Open directly on the completed masterpiece. No title screen, introduction, camera flight, construction animation, loading theatre, menu, empty ground plane or delayed reveal.
- Default to an elevated, carefully composed Trocadero-side three-quarter vista aligned across active fountains and the Seine toward the Eiffel Tower, with the full height of the tower dominant and enough Champ de Mars, riverfront and Paris roofscape visible to make the environment feel vast.
- The tower must consume the viewer's attention immediately, yet the frame must be almost unbelievably full: fountain spray sparkling in sunlight, Pont d'Iena traffic and pedestrians, bateaux on the river, tree canopies and paths, crowds as small scale cues, garden beds, distant limestone roofs and a bright Paris sky.
- Use a luminous late-spring afternoon just after a brief rain shower: wet stone catches highlights, fresh trees glow, water carries broken reflections and air clarity lets the structural precision read. Keep it bright, colorful and inviting, never murky or dominated by darkness.
- The scene must read as real Paris before the viewer interacts, without large text labels or explanatory panels.

#### THE EIFFEL TOWER - ENGINEERING AS JEWELRY
- Construct the complete tower with extraordinary structural hierarchy: four vast curved piers; crossing iron lattice at multiple scales; arches between legs; platform floors; railings; stairs; elevator tracks and cabins; observation decks; restaurants suggested behind glazing; antenna assemblies; beacon and small maintenance details.
- At hero distance, the silhouette and elegant taper must be perfect. At close range, expose densely layered ironwork, secondary beams, gusset plates, rivet patterns, mesh railings, stair landings, lift machinery housings, warning lamps, cables, glazing, tiny visitor silhouettes on platforms and warm paint variation on sun-facing versus shaded members.
- Make the base monumental and inhabitable: stone footings, ticket and security structures kept visually discreet, queues and visitors flowing beneath the legs, path barriers, benches, souvenir kiosks, shaded planting, maintenance access, elevator movement and shadows cast by the iron lattice across the ground.
- Light must travel through the structure: thousands of patterned shadows on grass and paving, sun glints moving over beams, atmospheric depth through layers of trusswork and subtle occlusion that makes it feel assembled rather than extruded.
- Never replace fidelity with abstract lines or a simplistic low-poly cone. From any close preset the landmark must reward examination.

#### THE COMPLETE AXIAL PARIS ENVIRONMENT
- Build the entire readable landmark axis as part of the subject: Trocadero terrace and descending gardens in the foreground, the active Warsaw-style fountain basin and jets, Pont d'Iena across the Seine, quay walls and riverside paths, Eiffel Tower on the Champ de Mars, the long lawns and tree avenues receding toward the Ecole Militaire direction.
- Create the Seine as a genuine moving layer of the environment: rippling green-blue water, sun sparkles, reflections of tower legs and bridge arches, tour boats and smaller craft with wakes, quay steps, mooring rings, riverside pedestrians, cyclists and shaded trees.
- Fill the Champ de Mars with refined life rather than visual clutter: clipped lawns, gravel paths, flowerbeds, symmetrical tree rows, families, photographers, picnics, joggers, gardeners, a few pigeons only where natural, benches, lamps and the subtle seasonal variation of leaves and blossoms.
- Beyond the immediate gardens, generate a rich Paris envelope: cream stone apartment blocks with mansard roofs, chimneys, dormer windows, balconies, awnings, cafe corners, road lanes, parked vehicles, moving buses and taxis, street trees, lampposts and distant skyline layers that fade correctly into haze.
- Nothing important may float on blank ground or stop at an abrupt edge. Use landscaped transitions, city blocks, river bends and atmospheric distance to make this feel like a complete place.

#### COUNTLESS SMALL STORIES ALREADY ALIVE
- The completed environment should be peacefully busy from first frame: fountains already dancing, elevators already climbing inside the tower, boats already passing beneath the bridge, pedestrians crossing, traffic moving, trees rustling and photographers turning toward the view.
- Stage readable human moments at different scales: a proposal photo being framed on the terrace, children at a fountain edge, a painter with an easel, a waiter setting cafe chairs near a side street, a riverboat upper deck of waving passengers, visitors pointing upward from beneath the tower and maintenance staff quietly checking a planted bed.
- Build people and vehicles as detailed but efficient stylized figures whose color and pose give scale and warmth without stealing focus from the landmark.
- Add fine atmospheric animation: fountain mist catching miniature rainbow fragments, wet leaves releasing droplets, flags shifting, boat wake reflections rolling across quay stone, elevator lights sliding upward and cloud shadows passing slowly over the lawn.
- Avoid spectacle that replaces the place: no fireworks, ring courses, giant fantasy additions, collapsing architecture or game objective. The shock is the reality and density of the living world itself.

#### MATERIALS, LIGHT AND MICRO-FIDELITY
- Use physically persuasive material contrast: painted iron with subtle roughness and warm brown variation; pale limestone buildings; wet gray-beige paving; transparent fountain spray; deep river water; waxy spring leaves; glass boat canopies; polished vehicle paint; metal railings and small golden lamps.
- Create procedural micro-texture where the camera can approach: paving seams and damp patches, garden gravel, bark, roof tile rhythms, balcony iron curls, window interior glow, river wall masonry, cobbled service routes, road markings and cafe terrace patterns.
- Use high-quality shadows, ambient occlusion cues, contact shadows and restrained bloom only for sun glints and small reflective accents. Avoid hazy over-bloom that erases lattice detail.
- Reflections must tell the story: distorted tower fragments in the Seine, fountains on wet paving, moving boats breaking reflected beams, glass observation decks catching sky and vehicles sliding through damp road highlights.

#### EXPLORATION THAT REVEALS CRAFT, NEVER HIDES IT
- Orbit, pan and zoom must function immediately, with a single reset returning to the spectacular full-axis hero composition.
- Include beautifully tuned camera presets: Trocadero full vista; low fountain-edge view through spray; riverside view with boat and reflected tower; beneath-the-iron-leg engineering close-up; observation platform looking down the Champ de Mars axis; overhead district model view showing gardens, river and surrounding blocks.
- Keep collision and near-plane behavior comfortable around structural geometry; allow close inspection without camera trapping inside the lattice.
- Meaningful compact controls only: daylight state (rain-cleared afternoon / golden sunset / sparkling blue hour), environment density (serene / lively / grand Paris day), fountain and river activity, and a structural detail spotlight toggle that gently emphasizes tower engineering without changing the scene into an infographic.
- UI must be small, elegant and collapsible, leaving the first frame almost entirely to Paris.

#### EXTREME DETAIL WITH DISCIPLINED PERFORMANCE
- Allocate bespoke maximum detail to the tower, closest fountain terraces, bridge, first river boats, near crowds and hero garden paths; every preset must have an obvious high-fidelity focal region.
- Use nested levels of detail: genuine fine tower geometry near the camera, simplified but silhouette-perfect structural layers at distance; dense instance fields for trees, figures, roof details, paving, lights, benches and vehicles; merged static city blocks beyond the primary vista.
- Use instanced animated systems for crowds, traffic, boats, fountain droplets, tree leaf clusters and distant window variation. Preserve the impression of limitless pieces while keeping draw calls rational.
- Provide a quality selector that preserves composition and landmark detail first: reduce far roof ornament, crowd count, foliage density and reflection sampling before sacrificing the tower's lattice, fountain hero layer or river reflections.
- Target a smooth interactive experience on a modern laptop, clamp devicePixelRatio to 2, pause expensive offscreen work and avoid memory explosions. The desired outcome is not a benchmark failure; it is the most overwhelmingly detailed Eiffel Tower world that remains pleasurable to explore.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - PARIS WITH PURPOSE
This is not a populated still-life. From the opening frame it must feel like an actual Paris afternoon continuing whether or not the viewer moves the camera. Use many lightweight autonomous agents with destinations, timing, state changes and visible interactions; do not scatter stationary crowd blobs around the landmark.
- Give visitors readable routines: couples enter the Trocadero overlook, pause for photographs, descend toward the fountains; families cross paths and settle briefly on lawns; tower visitors queue, advance beneath a leg and reappear as silhouettes on elevator decks. Photographers turn, frame a shot, then move aside rather than looping one idle pose.
- Make transport a connected flow system: buses and taxis follow lanes, slow at crossings, stop behind signals and continue; cyclists overtake on riverside paths; tour boats approach, pass beneath Pont d'Iena, throw wakes against the quay and carry seated or standing passenger silhouettes.
- Let agents affect the world: pedestrians avoid each other and pause at curb edges, fountain-edge children create small splash/ripple events, boats deform reflected water, elevator cabins rise on staggered schedules and gardeners move between planted beds with tools.
- Vary cadence and intent visibly: strolling, hurrying, queuing, resting, looking upward, photographing, boarding and crossing should form small believable stories across foreground, bridge, lawn and tower base.
Implement motion efficiently with instanced/stateful agent pools, path networks, simple avoidance and LOD. Preserve meaningful autonomous activity even at the calmest density setting; never replace life with identical walking loops, random jitter, frozen silhouettes or decorative dots.

<summary><strong>06. Golden Gate Bridge - Advanced</strong></summary>

```text
OBJECTIVE
Realistic representation of the Golden Gate Bridge with a hint of the Presidio and Marin Headlands, tuned to feel like the real San Francisco Bay. Prioritize a believable atmosphere/sky, water, and traffic flow.

USER CONTROLS
- Fog bank slider: 0 → 100%
  - Controls a **height-based fog bank** that lives mostly under and around the deck.
  - At 100% it should be unmistakably foggy around the bridge and water surface (even in Clear weather), rising and falling as a coherent bank, not just a global haze.
- Traffic density slider: 0 → 100%
  - Controls the number of vehicles on the roadway and approaches.
  - Vehicles drive continuously and loop seamlessly so traffic feels endless.
- Water waves slider: 0 → 100%
  - Controls how wavy/choppy the bay looks (wave height, choppiness, and whitewater/foam presence).
  - At 0% water is calmer (gentle ripples). At 100% (especially in Stormy) it should look close to storm conditions, not just a subtle height shift.
- Weather selector: presets (Clear, Marine layer, Overcast, Stormy)
  - Each preset should be **meaningfully different**, not minor tweaks.
  - Clouds should be visible and animated (layered drift), with cloud height/opacity responding to the active preset.
  - Clear: vibrant, believable blue sky; crisp visibility; minimal cloud cover.
  - Marine layer: a low fog bank/haze sitting near the water/under the deck; cooler lighting.
  - Overcast: heavy cloud cover with diffuse lighting; muted contrast but still clearly visible (not “can’t see anything”).
  - Stormy: dark clouds, rain, lightning; stronger waves; dramatic but still readable (not pure black or an overly aggressive rectangular haze layer). Lightning should briefly illuminate the scene/water.
  - Rain should be visibly present and make surfaces look wet (road/bridge sheen, occasional puddling).
- Time of day slider: Morning → Night
  - Drives sun/moon position, sky color, exposure, water color, stars, and intensities for night-time lights (deck lights, vehicle lights, skyline, Alcatraz).
  - Sunrise/sunset should be clearly visible and “golden hour” should feel distinct from midday.
- Comet button (available at night)
  - Pressing the button sends a visible comet across the sky **above the bridge**, traveling roughly perpendicular to the bridge’s span.
  - The comet should have a believable head + glowing tail (golden tint), without hard-edged halos.
  - It should briefly light up the environment in an impressive way and produce a visible reflection/response on the water.
- Whales button
  - Pressing the button spawns **1–5 humpback whales** in the bay (randomized count), behaving as a loose group.
  - Whales should look recognizable (not like submarines) and do typical behaviors: swimming, surfacing, breaching/tail slaps, etc.
  - They must stay in the water, avoid land, and avoid intersecting the bridge/structures.
  - Their motion should produce visible water interaction: ripples, spray/splashes, and disturbance that reads with the current wave conditions.
- Camera: Free orbit / pan / dolly (OrbitControls-style).
- UI readout: show current values for fog %, traffic %, waves %, whales count, and a time-of-day label.

SCENE CONTENT & BACKGROUND
- Golden Gate Bridge
  - Two Art Deco towers, suspension cables, and vertical hangers in correct “International Orange”.
  - Suspension system must read as structurally connected:
    - Main cables attach at tower tops and continue to both ends (anchorages), not terminating mid-air.
    - Vertical hangers run continuously from main cables down to the deck along the main span.
  - Bridge shape should be coherent and believable:
    - Towers are not floating; they connect to believable bases/footings at water/land.
    - Road deck and side edges/catwalk elements connect cleanly to approaches (no mismatched “edgy” shapes where a rounded/circular edge is expected).
- Roadway and traffic
  - Roadway on top of the deck plus approach roads on both sides with lane markings.
  - Approach roads should extend far enough that the visible road doesn’t end abruptly near the bridge (traffic should disappear off-screen naturally).
  - Multi-lane traffic in both directions:
    - Mix of cars and heavier vehicles (trucks/buses), with **10+ visually distinct vehicle archetypes** and realistic scale variation.
    - Vehicle colors must be varied and realistic (traditional automotive palette; avoid toy-like saturation; avoid “all grey”).
    - Vehicles must not overlap/clip through each other; maintain believable spacing so both directions read correctly.
    - Headlights/taillights are emissive and brighten as it gets darker.
- Terrain and shoreline
  - Natural terrain for Presidio (south) and Marin (north): rolling hills framing the bridge down to shoreline.
  - Vegetation shading: deeper greens near water, pushing into slightly dry/golden tones at higher elevations; avoid neon/flat greens.
  - Shoreline should look **natural**, not like a square cutout; land should extend to the edges of the simulation so the world doesn’t feel like a clipped rectangle.
  - Ensure water/shore interaction doesn’t flicker at shallow areas (no “z-fighting” look).
- San Francisco skyline (distant silhouette) on the Presidio side
  - Simple skyline silhouette with soft window/emissive detail that becomes more noticeable at night.
  - Night emissives should feel plausible (not overly harsh/glowy).
- Alcatraz hint
  - Small island with rocky base, a main prison block mass, and a simple tower/lighthouse element with subtle emissive at night.
- Bay water
  - Visually impressive water that avoids obvious tiling/square artifacts.
  - Multi-scale wave motion with foam/whitewater accents, especially at higher wave settings and stormy weather.
  - Reflects sun/moon and overall sky color in a believable, non-blinding way (avoid “white-out” reflections at midday).
  - Integrates with fog and weather (fog bank sits on/over it; stormy rain affects its look).
- Vessels
  - Several varied boats/ships (not just rectangles) such as cargo/container ships, tankers, and a ferry.
  - Ships should follow **purposeful routes** (e.g., recognizable shipping lanes / ferry route), not aimless drifting, and move independently with distinct speeds/phases.
  - Ships remain in the water and do not intersect land/bridge; light bobbing/wake is a plus if it reads well.
- Additional environment detail
  - Instanced trees placed on hillsides (no floating trees, none in water).
  - Small flock of birds circling/gliding near/around the bridge.
  - Distant background/bowl geometry to close the horizon.
- Sky, Sun, Moon, Stars
  - Day sky must be clearly **blue** in Clear weather, with a natural horizon haze gradient (not pale grey/white).
  - The sun should be visible as a disc/bright element when above the horizon, not just an overexposed white screen.
  - Morning vs midday vs afternoon should feel different; sunrise/sunset should be clearly warmer and more dramatic.
  - Night sky should be dark but not empty: visible moon and a tasteful starfield (stars present and noticeable, but not overly dense).
  - Stars fade in/out smoothly during the day→night transition.

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
- Create a Self-contained output that runs in a blank Chrome tab with no bundler/build step.
- Use Three.js as ES modules only:
  - Include an import map (before the module script) mapping `"three"` and `"three/addons/"` to the same pinned Three.js version.
  - Import only via those names (no other bare specifiers).
- Performance:
  - Use instanced meshes for repeated objects (cars, trees, skyline windows/buildings, etc.) and avoid unnecessary per-frame allocations.
- Code quality:
  - Never reuse identifiers in the same scope or shadow variables; prefer descriptive names.
- Rendering:
  - Physically plausible lighting setup (sun/moon directional, hemisphere/ambient fill as appropriate).
  - ACES-Filmic tone mapping and sRGB output.
  - Avoid deprecated Three.js settings and avoid any console errors/warnings (e.g., shader compile errors, WebGL feedback loop errors).

<summary><strong>07. Billion-Piece Istanbul - Hagia Sophia and the Golden Horn</strong></summary>

```text
Create an unprecedented, museum-quality Three.js environment of Istanbul's historic peninsula and the Golden Horn at golden hour: Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque crowning the skyline, the Galata Bridge alive with fishermen and traffic, ferries crossing glittering water, gulls wheeling through warm light, and the layered city rising on both shores. This must not be a single isolated mosque, a sparse waterfront, a generic Middle-Eastern skyline or a postcard with three props. It is the complete living panorama of one of the greatest city views on Earth.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: domes and semi-domes, minaret balconies, lead roof seams, courtyard arcades, bazaar awnings, rooftop terraces, chimneys, satellite dishes, ferry railings, fishing rods, mooring bollards, cobbles, cypress trees, and thousands of windows catching the sun. Achieve this with extreme visible detail, intelligent instancing, merged geometry and distance-aware density rather than unusable raw geometry.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate everything procedurally; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE IMPERIAL SKYLINE IN GOLD
- Open directly on the completed masterpiece: a view from above the Galata side looking across the Golden Horn toward the historic peninsula, Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque silhouetted against warm late-afternoon light, the water between filled with moving ferries and their wakes.
- The frame must be spectacularly full: the Galata Bridge with its double deck of traffic above and restaurants below, dozens of fishermen with lines in the water, white ferries with red trim crossing in both directions, gulls circling and diving, domes and minarets stacked up the hill, and the dense texture of the city rolling away in every direction.
- Light is the soul: low golden sun raking across lead domes, glinting off windows on the Asian shore, scattering in ferry wakes, and warming the limestone and brick of the old city. Bright, warm and inviting; never murky.
- No labels, menus or introductions. It must read as Istanbul within one second.

#### THE MONUMENTS - CROWNS OF THE PENINSULA
- Build Hagia Sophia with true structural character: the great central dome with its ring of windows, cascading semi-domes, massive buttresses, four minarets of differing character, pink-toned masonry, and courtyard trees. At distance the silhouette must be perfect; up close, window grilles, lead roof panels, cornice detail and weathering must reward inspection.
- Build the Blue Mosque as its counterpart: the nested cascade of domes, six slender minarets with multiple balconies, the arcaded courtyard, and its cooler grey-blue tone against Hagia Sophia's warmth.
- Support them with the honest fabric of Sultanahmet: Topkapi's walls and pavilion roofs among trees on the point, the Basilica Cistern's ventilation domes hinted in the ground plane, tram lines, fountains, plane trees, and the descending terraces of houses, hotels and shops down to the water.

#### THE GOLDEN HORN AND THE BRIDGE
- The water is a primary character: a broad, living surface with sun glitter, crossing ferry wakes that interact, current texture, reflected minarets breaking in the chop, and moored boats rocking gently.
- The Galata Bridge must be fully alive: instanced fishermen with individual rods and occasional catches, strolling pedestrians, the tram crossing, cars and taxis, and the under-deck restaurant level with tables, lanterns and waiters visible between arches.
- Ferry traffic runs as a genuine system: vessels departing Eminonu and Karakoy piers, swinging wide, passing each other with correct wakes, docking with reversing churn, passengers visible on decks. Add water taxis, a fishing boat or two trailing gulls, and simit sellers with red carts on the quays.
- Gulls are a signature layer: flocks wheeling around minarets, following ferries, landing on bridge railings, individually animated with banking turns and glides catching the light.

#### THE CITY FABRIC - TEXTURE WITHOUT END
- Fill both shores with dense, varied, honest city: Ottoman timber houses, mid-rise apartment blocks with balconies and laundry, mosque after smaller mosque, the Galata Tower rising on its hill, the spice bazaar roofline, hans and workshops, rooftop terraces with tea tables, cypress and plane trees, and streets that visibly carry traffic and pedestrians up the slopes.
- Distant layers must recede correctly into warm haze: the Bosphorus opening to the right with a suspension bridge hinted far away, the Asian shore glittering, ship traffic at anchor.
- Nothing may stop at an abrupt edge; the city dissolves into atmospheric distance in every direction.

#### COUNTLESS SMALL STORIES ALREADY ALIVE
- Stage readable human moments: a fisherman lifting a flashing catch, a ferry passenger throwing bread to gulls mid-crossing, tea being carried on a swinging tray across the bridge, a wedding photo on a terrace, kids racing down steps toward the quay, a cat sunning on a warm wall (this is Istanbul; include its cats).
- All agents are autonomous with destinations and routines: ferries on schedules, fishermen recasting, walkers with intent, gull flocks reacting to ferries and food.
- Fine atmospheric animation everywhere: flags, awnings, laundry, steam from tea urns, shimmering sun path on water, slow cloud shadows crossing the hills.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Orbit, pan and zoom immediately; a single reset returns to the golden hero panorama.
- Camera presets: the classic Galata-side panorama; bridge deck among the fishermen; ferry bow mid-crossing with gulls; Sultanahmet terrace between the two great mosques; high aerial showing the Horn, the point and the Bosphorus junction.
- Compact controls only: time of light (golden hour / soft morning / blue evening with lit minarets), water traffic density, gull density, and a photo mode hiding UI.

#### EXTREME DETAIL WITH DISCIPLINED PERFORMANCE
- Bespoke maximum detail on Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the bridge and the nearest ferries; every preset has an obvious high-fidelity focal region.
- Nested LOD everywhere: full monument geometry near camera, silhouette-perfect distant structures, instanced windows, roof tiles, figures, gulls, boats and trees, merged far hillsides.
- Quality selector reduces far city ornament, crowd and gull counts and reflection sampling before ever sacrificing monument fidelity or water life.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, memory rational. The outcome: the definitive living Istanbul panorama.

<summary><strong>08. Billion-Piece Harbin - The Glowing City of Ice</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js environment of the Harbin Ice and Snow World at blue hour: an entire city of palaces, towers, bridges, and colonnades built from translucent ice blocks, every structure glowing from within by embedded colored light, under a deep indigo winter sky. This must not be a single ice sculpture, a sparse plaza with a few glowing boxes, a daytime scene, or a murky night render. It is a complete luminous ice metropolis whose scale and inner light make the viewer stop immediately.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually stacked ice blocks: walls with visible block courses, frozen mortar seams, staircases, battlements, arched gates, spiral towers, an ice Ferris-wheel silhouette, long slide chutes with riders, lantern rows, and carved statues, all reading as real cut ice rather than tinted glass boxes. Achieve this through extreme visible detail, intelligent instancing, merged geometry and distance-aware density, not literal unusable geometry counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate all geometry, materials, lighting, people and snow procedurally; no external images or models.

#### FIRST FRAME - A CITY OF LIGHT MADE OF ICE
- Open directly on the completed masterpiece: an elevated three-quarter vista down the central boulevard of the ice city, the tallest glowing ice tower dominant, ranks of lit palaces receding into frosted haze on both sides.
- The sky is deep blue dusk, not black: enough ambient cold light to read silhouettes, with the city itself supplying most illumination in saturated bands of aquamarine, magenta, amber and emerald glowing through the ice.
- The frame must be almost unbelievably full: crowds in thick winter coats moving along swept paths, breath fog rising, children on ice slides mid-descent, food-stall steam, string lights, flag lines, distant frozen river and city glow on the horizon.
- No title screens, menus, loading theatre, camera flights or delayed reveals. The city is simply there, complete and alive.

#### ICE AS THE HERO MATERIAL
- Ice must read as genuine cut river ice: translucent with visible internal depth, air bubbles and fracture planes suspended inside blocks, frost bloom on surfaces, sharp specular glints on edges, and colored light scattering through thickness so towers glow brighter at their cores and softer at their skins.
- Build a believable subsurface-glow model: embedded light sources inside walls create gradients across block courses; adjacent blocks vary subtly in clarity and tint; thin elements like balustrades transmit more light than massive bases.
- Snow must be its own material family: dry squeaky path snow with footprint texture, powder banks with sparkle glints, drifted roof caps, and slow light snowfall catching every colored light source.
- Never let ice become flat emissive plastic. Every close approach should reveal block seams, tool marks, drip icicles, refrozen melt ripples and frost crystals.

#### THE COMPLETE ICE METROPOLIS
- Build a full district, not one building: a grand central palace with towers and curtain walls, an ice pagoda, a cathedral-like colonnade, triumphal gates, at least one long multi-lane ice slide with continuous riders, bridges over a frozen channel, a sculpture garden of carved translucent figures, lantern-lined boulevards and a plaza with a lit ice maze.
- Surround the core with supporting life: ticket gates, warm-lit food stalls with rising steam, vendors, benches, snow-clearing crews, parked snow groomers, flagpoles, and the frozen Songhua river plane stretching behind the city with distant Harbin city lights.
- Nothing floats on empty black ground. Paths, snowbanks, ice channel, river and horizon glow must form a complete, inhabitable winter world.

#### A CROWD THAT BELONGS TO -30 DEGREES
- Populate generously with instanced, individually varied visitors in bright padded coats, fur hoods and scarves: strolling couples, photo-takers, queueing slide riders, kids being pulled on small sleds, staff in reflective vests.
- Every figure exhales visible breath fog on a natural rhythm; walkers leave subtle footprint trails on fresh snow; slide riders descend with real acceleration and a puff of snow at the runout.
- Stage readable micro-stories: a family group photo with a tower glow behind them, a vendor handing over skewers with steam, a child hesitating at the top of a slide then going, maintenance staff replacing a lantern.
- Crowds are autonomous agents with destinations, queues and pauses, not looping mannequins scattered at random.

#### LIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY AND DYNAMISM
- The city lighting is alive: slow coordinated color programs sweep across districts, towers shift hue over tens of seconds, lantern rows twinkle, and occasional gentle pulses travel down colonnades. Keep transitions elegant, never seizure-strobing.
- Add fine atmospheric animation: snowfall density drifting with light wind, steam plumes, flags moving, faint aurora-like sky gradient, sparkle glints crawling across frost as the camera moves.
- Reflections matter: colored light pooling on polished ice paths, blurred tower reflections in the frozen channel, glints in visitors' goggles and camera phones.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Orbit, pan and zoom active immediately; one reset returns to the hero boulevard vista.
- Camera presets: boulevard hero view; low plaza view between crowds toward the great tower; top of the ice slide looking down the lanes; bridge over the frozen channel with reflections; high aerial revealing the whole glowing city plan against the dark river.
- Compact, elegant controls only: lighting program (classic multicolor / single-hue elegance / warm festival), snowfall intensity, crowd density, and a photo mode that hides UI.
- Keep the camera comfortable: no trapping inside walls, sensible near-plane, gentle collision around structures.

#### EXTREME DETAIL WITH DISCIPLINED PERFORMANCE
- Allocate bespoke maximum detail to the central palace, nearest boulevard, hero slide and closest crowds; every preset frames at least one high-fidelity focal region.
- Use nested LOD: full block-course geometry with internal glow near camera; silhouette-perfect simplified structures at distance; instanced crowds, lanterns, icicles, breath puffs and snow particles; merged far district geometry.
- Provide a quality selector that reduces far crowd count, snowfall density and reflection cost before ever sacrificing ice translucency, block detail or the glow gradients.
- Target smooth interaction on a modern laptop, clamp devicePixelRatio to 2, and keep memory rational. The outcome is the most overwhelming glowing ice city that still runs beautifully.

<summary><strong>09. Billion-Piece Forbidden City - First Snow Across the Imperial Palace</strong></summary>

```text
Create a monumental Three.js environment of Beijing's Forbidden City during the first clear snowfall of winter: an immense, ordered palace world of vermilion walls, golden tiled roofs capped with fresh white snow, marble terraces, gates, ceremonial courtyards, bridges, gardens, lantern warmth and distant palace layers unfolding toward the horizon. This should be instantly recognizable as the imperial palace complex in a breathtaking full environmental composition, not a generic Chinese temple courtyard, one isolated gate or a crowded festival vignette.

The scene must feel built from a billion precise details: roof tiles, ridge beasts, brackets, painted beam patterns, carved marble balustrades, stair reliefs, paving stones, red doors and studs, snow clumps, lantern tassels, bare branches, evergreen needles, courtyard footprints, frozen-water glints, tiny visitors and layer after layer of roofline receding in atmospheric winter light. Achieve the effect with procedural architectural systems, reusable components, instancing and LOD, maintaining clarity, respect and fluid exploration.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate architecture, snow, materials, foliage, figures, lanterns, lighting and animation procedurally without external image or model assets. Use a fine handcrafted micro-block language for tile rhythms, stone, landscaping and ornament, while ensuring the roofs, halls, axes and courtyards remain majestic and not cartoonishly simplified.

#### FIRST FRAME - AN IMPERIAL WORLD UNDER NEW SNOW
- Open directly on a bright high three-quarter axial view across a great courtyard toward a magnificent central hall on its marble platform, with successive gates and roof layers visible beyond, red walls enclosing the composition, golden roofs brushed in white snow and enough scale to communicate the vast palace city.
- Compose the first image with exact visual power: broad stone courtyard carrying delicate tracks, white marble terraces and bridges, dark winter trees and small pine accents, red-and-gold architecture, warm lantern points and a clear pale-blue sky after snowfall.
- Small bundled visitors or caretakers provide scale at a respectful distance; the complex itself overwhelms. Avoid parade crowds, martial action, excessive holiday decoration or invented spectacle.
- No slow snowfall reveal, title panel, interior tour menu or empty courtyard waiting for atmosphere. The serene astonishing scene is complete on load.

#### PALACE ARCHITECTURE AS COUNTLESS CRAFTED LAYERS
- Build a complete readable central-axis world: monumental gate thresholds, vast courtyards, central throne-hall-scale buildings on marble terraces, flanking halls, perimeter corridors, high red walls, repeating gateways and receding rooflines that imply the scale of the entire Forbidden City.
- Render roofs with extraordinary care: golden glazed tile rows, snow accumulation along ridges and eaves, ornate ridge figures as tiny silhouettes, corner sweeps, brackets below eaves, painted beam patterns, snow melt glints and icicles used sparingly in shade.
- Make stone and wood close-range rewards: carved marble railings and ramps, steps softened by snow, drum-like bases, doors with rows of studs, vermilion wood shading, gilded accents, columns, screens, lantern mounts, drainage channels and pavement joints.
- Include garden transitions where composition allows: old cypress trees, bare winter branches, rock groupings, sheltered corridors, small frozen or reflective water elements and snow-resting shrubs.

#### LIGHT, STILLNESS AND QUIET HUMAN LIFE
- Let sunlight after snowfall be the spectacle: clean white roofs intensify gold and red, long blue shadows cross stone, warm lanterns under covered corridors contrast with cold air and every ornament appears unusually crisp.
- Add restrained living motion: occasional fine snow falling from a branch or roof edge, lantern tassels in a breeze, caretakers clearing a narrow path, visitors slowly crossing a terrace, tree shadows shifting, birds lifting over successive roof planes and warm light behind selected lattice windows.
- Stage small stories without losing solemnity: two visitors pausing at a balustrade, a caretaker brushing snow from steps, a lantern being adjusted beneath an eave, distant figures passing through a gate and footprints fading into the immense courtyard scale.
- The emotional effect is serenity, historical scale and rare beauty: the first snowfall revealing architectural order in a way that feels unforgettable.

#### EXPLORE THE COMPLETE PALACE AXIS
- Enable orbit, pan and zoom immediately with reset to the snow-bright central-axis hero view. Camera presets: grand courtyard vista; marble terrace and hall facade; roof-and-snow ornament close-up; gate passage framing successive halls; quiet winter garden corridor; high panorama revealing repeating palace layers.
- Compact controls: weather state (fresh snow sunlight / gentle ongoing snow / autumn clear day), lantern warmth, visitor density and time-of-day. Bright snow-cleared daylight remains the opening and primary masterpiece.
- Preserve respect and clarity: no interiors invented as gaudy fantasy, no combat, no oversized dragons, no text-heavy historical guide and no gimmick that overwhelms the real beauty of the palace environment.

#### EXTREME DETAIL WITH ARCHITECTURAL ORDER
- Put maximum detail into the primary hall, foreground courtyard paving, marble platforms, nearest gates, roofs and snow interaction. Use modular procedural architecture and instanced tile, balustrade, column, lantern, tree and distant-visitor systems for vast receding layers.
- Build snow efficiently through controlled masks, roof-edge accumulation, instanced clumps, footprints and subtle falling particles rather than expensive physical simulation.
- Reduce far palace layers, visitor count and tree subdetail before compromising the main roof ornament, terrace carving or snow-lit hero frame.
- Clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and target smooth exploration. The viewer must be able to stand before a limitless imperial world, admire the whole axis instantly, then move close enough to feel that every roof tile and snow-shadow was placed with care.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - QUIET LIFE ACROSS THE SNOW
The palace complex should remain serene, but serenity is not immobility. It must convey sparse, purposeful daily movement across an immense winter world rather than fixed visitor dots placed for scale.
- Give each visible person a respectful role and route: caretakers clear narrow paths and pause to brush steps, attendants adjust lanterns beneath eaves, visitors walk slowly from gate to terrace, stop at a balustrade and continue through the next threshold.
- Make snow remember activity: new footprints extend behind walkers, swept paths accumulate at edges, a cart or broom leaves subtle marks, disturbed roof snow drops after wind or birds lift, and melt glints alter along sunlit eaves.
- Establish layered rhythms along the central axis: distant figures pass from gateway to courtyard, lantern tassels and flags respond to breeze, birds relocate across roofs, warm window light changes in a few sheltered corridors and ongoing fine snowfall varies without obscuring architecture.
- Use low population with high legibility: a small number of agents performing understandable tasks makes the scale more convincing than dense crowds or unmoving silhouettes.
Implement waypoint-based figures, task states, footprint/clearing decals or efficient equivalents and staggered ambient responses. The palace remains solemn and uncluttered, yet never frozen or filled with ornamental human blobs.

<summary><strong>10. Billion-Piece Pileh Lagoon - The Complete Phi Phi Leh Paradise</strong></summary>

```text
Create an unbelievably detailed Three.js paradise world centered on Pileh Lagoon at Phi Phi Leh: an enclosed, radiant turquoise lagoon wrapped by soaring jungle-covered limestone walls, entered by traditional long-tail boats and experienced as a complete living tropical sanctuary. This is a deliberately far more ambitious full-world edition than a simple lagoon arrival scene: the viewer must see crystalline water, sculpted karst walls, hidden ledges, reef shallows, dense foliage, boats, swimmers, kayaks, birds, fish, sea opening and every sunlit wet surface as one astonishingly complete environment on frame one.

Make the viewer feel that an entire paradise was built from a billion tiny acts of care: limestone fissures and ledges, hanging roots, dripping vines, palm fronds, leaf highlights, underwater stones, sand ripples, coral patches, fish schools, boat planks, woven canopies, ribbons, ropes, paddle drips, swimmer wakes, spray, reflections and faraway cliff flora. Deliver that apparent impossibility through intelligent procedural richness, instances and levels of detail rather than literal excess meshes.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate all cliffs, water, foliage, vessels, people, wildlife, materials, light and animation procedurally without external assets. Fine micro-block craftsmanship may structure rock faces, boats, plant clusters and reefs; the water must remain glassy, continuous, translucent and the single most beautiful visual achievement in the page.

#### FIRST FRAME - PARADISE AS AN ENTIRE WORLD
- Open directly from an elevated inside-the-lagoon vista with a richly detailed long-tail boat at near left, transparent turquoise shallows sweeping across the foreground, several gracefully scaled boats and kayaks in the middle distance, and immense curved limestone walls enclosing the water almost to the sky.
- Reveal the bright narrow seaward entrance between karsts, but keep the viewer undeniably inside the lagoon. Show the full bowl of water and cliffs rather than an approach from generic ocean.
- Make the composition dense yet peaceful: fish and reef beneath clear water, swimmers as tiny scale cues, vines and palms spilling from cliffs, birds circling above, reflected rock shadow and brilliant sunlit water expanding in layers.
- Default to vivid late morning immediately after a tropical shower, with saturated jungle, gleaming limestone, turquoise water glowing from within, fine mist and fragments of rainbow. There is no title screen, no tourism interface and no delayed arrival.

#### WATER DEEP ENOUGH TO FALL IN LOVE WITH
- Build exceptionally nuanced lagoon water: transparent aqua sand shelves, electric turquoise channels, deep emerald cliff reflections, shaded blue-green caves, surface sparkles, sun caustics, moving wakes, paddle rings and falling droplets.
- Under the surface show a complete shallow world: rippled white sand, limestone stones, coral and sea-grass patches, rays of sun, dozens of small fish schooling and turning, the soft shadows of boats and swimmers and reef color visible through the moving surface.
- Water interacts convincingly with everything: wakes split behind boats, cliff drips touch the surface, swimmers leave gentle ripples, kayak paddles shed droplets, fish disturb highlights and falling spray from wet ledges creates tiny rings.
- Keep the water pristine, irresistible and dominant; do not turn this into a crowded marina or speedboat attraction.

#### KARSTS, JUNGLE AND HUMAN-SCALE CRAFT
- Build the cliffs as giant sculptures with astonishing close-range variety: pale limestone faces, dark wet bases, vertical grooves, caves, undercuts, high ledges, rock bridges, calcite streaks, moss seams, dripping surfaces and intense scale against boats below.
- Cover them with layered tropical life: palms angled toward sun, broad leaf clusters, vines, roots, orchids, ferns, tiny flowering plants, hanging shrubs, birds perched on ledges and leaf litter gathered in sheltered coves.
- Model near long-tail boats as masterworks: varnished teak planks, engine assembly and propeller shaft, woven canopy, colored ribbons, ropes, anchors, cushions, coolers, snorkeling equipment and reflected hull details. Additional boats must vary naturally in color, position and activity.
- Add small beautiful stories: a kayak gliding along shadowed rock, snorkelers peering into the clear water, a guide securing a boat gently away from reef, a bird diving toward fish and petals drifting out from jungle overhang.

#### EXPLORATION AND PRACTICAL EXCESS
- Allow orbit, pan and zoom immediately, with reset to the grand enclosed-lagoon vista. Camera presets: complete lagoon basin; waterline beside the detailed boat; underwater-through-surface reef shallows; cliff-wall kayak glide; seaward opening framed by karsts; overhead water-color composition.
- Compact controls only: sunlight/weather mood, water clarity and caustic strength, lagoon activity density and tide depth. Default remains tranquil, intensely bright and instantly spectacular.
- Spend maximum fidelity on water, near boat, hero cliff arcs, underwater foreground and visible vegetation. Instance fish, leaf clusters, rock microforms, distant boats, birds and droplets; use layered efficient water effects rather than expensive simulation.
- Reduce remote foliage and background wildlife before diminishing the glowing water, cliff monumentality or handcrafted boat. Clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and target smooth exploration on a modern laptop.
- The final world must not merely suggest a beautiful lagoon. It must make the viewer feel they have suddenly arrived inside the most impossibly detailed, lucid tropical water paradise on Earth.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - A LAGOON PEOPLE MOVE THROUGH
The lagoon should retain tranquility while feeling like a real water place with ongoing, respectful human and natural motion. Boats and swimmers cannot be parked ornaments in perfect water.
- Give vessels believable journeys: a long-tail boat eases in through the seaward opening, follows a safe channel, throttles down, turns and anchors; another departs slowly, leaving an evolving wake. Kayaks hug cliff shade, paddle, coast and change heading around rocks.
- Let small groups act naturally: snorkelers enter water from an anchored boat, spread toward visible reef patches, regroup and climb back aboard; a guide manages rope or equipment; swimmers tread, turn and create overlapping rings rather than remaining fixed dots.
- Animate the ecosystem as a response system: fish schools evade swimmers and boat shadows then reform, birds move between ledges and water, cliff drips generate localized ripples, leaves drift on currents and wakes distort caustics over sand and reef.
- Protect the paradise mood through low counts and rich behavior: fewer agents with clear routes and reactions are better than a dense static tourism crowd.
Use channel paths, boat states, paddle/wake events, flocking fish and simple human action cycles with varied timing. The activity slider controls how many journeys occur, not whether the world is alive; never populate the basin with unmoving boats, swimmer blobs or identical looped fish.

<summary><strong>11. Billion-Piece Atlantis Still Alive - The Sunken Capital Beneath the Whale</strong></summary>

```text
Create a staggering Three.js vision of Atlantis not as a ruin, but as a living underwater capital: an immense luminous civilization beneath a crystal-blue ocean, built around concentric boulevards and canals, coral-overgrown palaces, glass domes, golden towers, illuminated plazas, gardens of sea life, schools of fish and citizens moving through protected spaces, while a colossal whale glides overhead and sunbeams reach down from the surface. The first frame must deliver the entire unbelievable idea instantly: a magnificent inhabited city below the sea, not a few broken columns or a generic aquarium with buildings.

The scene should feel composed of a billion tiny marvels: patterned streets, columns, domes, arches, mosaic plazas, shell and coral detail, windows, lanterns, bubble trails, kelp forests, sea fans, rays, turtles, fish schools, vehicles or elegant submersible transports, interior silhouettes, drifting particles and moving caustic light. Use procedural geometry, dense instancing, layered shaders and level of detail to generate an astonishingly complete underwater world while keeping it fluid to explore.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate all architecture, water volume, caustics, marine life, people, plants, materials, lighting and animation procedurally without external assets. A jewel-like micro-voxel craft aesthetic may enrich architecture, coral gardens and mosaics, while the water, whale, rays and sunlight must remain graceful, continuous and cinematic.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE CITY THAT SHOULD NOT EXIST
- Open directly from a grand elevated underwater viewpoint on the rim of the capital: a foreground coral terrace and statuesque architectural edge frame a vast radiant city below, with concentric districts, domes and tower clusters leading toward a central palace; above it all a giant whale passes through bright surface rays, instantly establishing ocean scale.
- Make the city alive and luminous rather than dark: blue and turquoise water, warm golden architectural lights, pearl and jade structures, coral colors, bright caustics, clear silhouettes and schools of fish crossing near the camera.
- Include multiple depth layers: close reef-and-building craftsmanship, central ceremonial city, distant residential rings and monumental outer arches dissolving into blue water, plus the shimmering surface far above.
- No slow discovery, darkness, disaster story, empty ruin or UI exposition. Atlantis is already thriving and the first image is the reward.

#### AN UNDERWATER CAPITAL WITH URBAN GRANDEUR
- Construct a coherent city plan visible from the hero view: grand central domed palace, concentric avenues or canal rings, radiating bridges, civic plazas, temple-like towers, glass habitats, terrace gardens, transit routes, gateways and outer neighborhoods merged with reefs.
- Make architecture impossibly lavish: pearl-stone columns, golden ribs, translucent domes, shell spirals, carved sea motifs, mosaic paths, balustrades, glowing windows, arched bridges, fountain-like bubble vents, coral cultivated along terraces and enormous statues suggested in silhouette without clutter.
- Populate protected interiors and breathable public spaces through glowing domes and windows: tiny residents crossing plazas, gardens moving in filtered light, market-like colors, observation galleries and graceful transport loops.
- Show nature embracing design rather than destroying it: coral and anemones cultivated on selected structures, kelp parks, ray corridors, fish moving through archways and gardens that make the city feel ecologically alive.

#### THE OCEAN AS A MOVING SKY
- The water column must be a masterwork: volumetric sun shafts, drifting particulates, surface shimmer overhead, large slow caustic patterns over city stone, blue atmospheric depth and softly moving shadows when whales or schools cross the light.
- Fill the ecosystem with beautifully staged marine life: the immense hero whale and calf option at distance, manta rays sweeping above plazas, turtles near coral gardens, huge schools of silvery fish turning as one, small reef fish among foreground plants and jellyfish lantern-like drifts in quieter districts.
- Use bubbles and movement as life cues: transit bubble trails, gentle vent streams, residents or divers only where coherent, swaying kelp, fin motion and whale wake pressure suggested through shifting particulate bands.
- Avoid menace, predators attacking, flooding catastrophe or ruined-city sadness. This is the overwhelming wonder of a fully functioning ocean civilization.

#### THE WHALE ABOVE THE CAPITAL
- Make the overhead whale an unforgettable scale anchor, not a decorative silhouette: sculpt a graceful detailed body with subtle skin variation, flippers, tail motion, light rolling over its back and immense shadow passing over towers; keep it high enough for the city to remain the main subject.
- Coordinate the first moment so the whale is already crossing a shaft of sunlight above the central district, with schools parting below and citizens or rays tiny against its scale.
- Include an alternate preset closer to the whale looking down through sunbeams onto Atlantis, making the full city appear even more impossible while preserving tranquility.

#### EXPLORATION, COLOR AND ENGINEERED ABUNDANCE
- Enable immediate orbit, pan and zoom with reset to the city-and-whale hero composition. Presets: grand capital overlook; central dome plaza; coral garden avenue; under-whale view down onto city; outer arch and kelp district; surface-facing panorama through rays.
- Compact controls: sunbeam/water clarity, city activity, marine-life density and architectural illumination mode (sunlit day / glowing twilight depths). Keep the default bright, crystalline and fully readable.
- Reserve handcrafted maximum detail for central palace, foreground terrace, nearby domes, coral plants and hero marine life. Instance repeated city modules, distant lights, mosaic details, schools, kelp and particulates with organic variation.
- Use efficient volumetric approximations, layered caustics, pooled bubble systems and LOD for distant districts. Scale outer-city density, fish counts and volumetric samples before sacrificing whale grace, central architecture or luminous water.
- Clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and maintain smooth exploration. This world should feel so rich and alive that an impossible myth has become a place the viewer can immediately see, understand and ache to explore.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - A CITY AND ECOSYSTEM THAT BREATHE
Atlantis must be demonstrated as alive through continuous civic and marine behavior, not merely labelled living by glowing windows and static fish shapes. The opening city-and-whale composition should already contain multiple purposeful flows.
- Give citizens and transport urban routines: residents move within domes and protected plazas, gather briefly at transit nodes, cross bridges and disperse; elegant submersible vehicles follow luminous lanes, dock, release passengers or cargo and depart with evolving bubble trails.
- Make the marine ecosystem autonomous: fish schools turn around architecture and split before rays or the whale shadow, turtles travel between coral gardens, manta rays sweep across plaza light, jellyfish drift on currents and kelp bends in coherent water flow rather than looping randomly.
- Let the hero whale change the city moment: its progress across sunbeams casts an enormous moving shadow; schools part then reform, rays alter paths, particulate bands and caustics change beneath it, and tiny citizens or transports provide astonishing scale.
- Connect districts through signals of function: bubble vents pulse as services operate, windows brighten and dim across occupied routes, cultivated coral gardens are tended and transit activity varies across central and outer neighborhoods.
Use stateful instanced residents, vehicles and schools; flow fields, route rings, docking states and efficient reaction triggers; retain performance through LOD. Every density mode must preserve inhabited behavior. Never settle for frozen silhouettes, identical fish or a city that only glows while nothing meaningfully moves.

<summary><strong>12. Billion-Piece Emerald City - At the End of the Yellow Brick Road</strong></summary>

```text
Create a breathtaking Three.js vision of the Emerald City at the end of the Yellow Brick Road: a complete fantastical destination city blazing with green crystal towers, art-deco spires, glass domes, gardens, gates, markets, bridges, fountains and citizens, framed by rolling poppy fields and the golden road arriving dramatically through the foreground. This should be the childhood dream of finally seeing the city for the first time, realized with extreme modern visual detail. It is not one green castle, a road leading to fog, a minimal skyline or a character scene; it is a complete radiant world so detailed that the viewer wants to wander every street.

Make the first image instantly legible and emotionally overwhelming: the yellow brick road starts beneath the camera, curves through jewel-colored countryside and arrives at vast open emerald gates; beyond them a densely populated shining metropolis rises layer after layer into a brilliant sky. The perceived billion-piece craft comes from thousands of articulated facets, bricks, windows, tiled roofs, garden plants, lamp posts, market awnings, people, banners, fountain droplets, vehicles and reflected city layers, implemented through procedural families, instancing and LOD rather than reckless mesh counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate all structures, materials, road, gardens, citizens, light and animation procedurally without downloaded assets. Use an exquisite micro-block construction language for brickwork, rooftops, streets, foliage and ornamental detail, while keeping crystal towers elegantly faceted, luminous and architecturally coherent.

#### FIRST FRAME - ARRIVAL AT THE CITY OF DREAMS
- Begin directly on a bright elevated arrival vista: richly textured yellow bricks in the near foreground; flowering fields, hedges and fanciful roadside trees leading toward enormous jeweled gates; an impossible emerald metropolis filling the middle and distance.
- The skyline must be shocking: one grand central palace-like tower cluster surrounded by numerous varied spires, domes, terraces, arched skybridges, hanging gardens, glittering rooftops and glowing window patterns, all unmistakably emerald without becoming a flat green blob.
- Put activity visibly in the scene immediately: gate crowds moving in welcome, small elegant carriages and trams entering the city, flags and banners fluttering, fountains throwing bright spray, market plazas sparkling behind the gate and tiny silhouettes crossing bridges high above.
- Default light is a flawless jewel-bright afternoon after a passing shower: emerald glass catches sun, yellow bricks glow warmly, poppies and gardens provide red and multicolor contrast, water reflects towers and the sky feels open and joyous. No dark mystery or slow reveal.

#### A CITY WORTH REACHING
- Construct the Emerald City as a full urban world with districts readable in one view: ceremonial gate avenue, central crystal palace, garden terraces, domed conservatories, theatrical plazas, market arcades, canal-like reflective pools, rooftop promenades, transit lines, surrounding walls and distant residential spires.
- Every tower needs layered craftsmanship: faceted green glass, metal ribs, ornate window frames, terraces, balconies, finials, banners, stairways, lift glows, rooftop gardens, carved stone bases, doorways and reflections of neighboring architecture.
- Create an unforgettable gate: monumental emerald archways, gold hinges and trim, patterned entry plaza, sentry pavilions used as architecture rather than threat, flower-filled planters, fountains and the yellow road transforming into a glittering city boulevard beyond.
- Make the city dense but composed. Establish grand axes, plazas and green vertical rhythm so detail increases wonder rather than creating visual noise.

#### THE ROAD, THE LAND AND THE LIVING CITY
- The Yellow Brick Road is not a token stripe. Give it individual warm bricks, curved joins, worn footsteps, puddle glints, grassy edges, scattered petals, small bridge crossings and widening ceremonial paving at the gate.
- Surround the approach with a lush storybook world: bright meadows, poppy bands, orchards of unusual shapes, wind-driven flowers, brooks, signposts as tiny visual accents, rolling hills and beautiful trees that make the emerald skyline more magical by contrast.
- Populate the city with welcoming readable life rather than crowds of noise: citizens in jewel-toned clothing, gardeners, musicians at a plaza, merchants beneath striped awnings, families entering through the gate, trams gliding on shining tracks and balloon-like or elegant carriage accents if they remain tasteful.
- Add many simultaneous micro-stories: someone stepping from the final yellow brick onto emerald paving, flowers being carried into a market, a fountain maintenance worker, rooftop dancers as tiny silhouettes, a tram reflecting the palace and birds spiraling near upper towers.

#### CRYSTAL, GOLD, WATER AND LIGHT
- Make emerald material variety lavish: deep green stone foundations, translucent crystal panels, glowing glass edges, oxidized and bright metal trims, jade tiles, polished plaza paving, golden accents and thousands of reflected sky highlights.
- Contrast it with the warm tactile road, saturated flowers, blue water, pale clouds and sunlit countryside so recognition is instantaneous and the image remains welcoming rather than monochrome.
- Use reflective pools, fountains and rain-cleared paving to duplicate the skyline beautifully. Let tower reflections break under fountain ripples, tram movement and footsteps.
- Use restraint in glow and bloom: the city should glitter with constructed detail, not dissolve into green neon haze.

#### IMMEDIATE EXPLORATION OF WONDER
- Orbit, pan and zoom are active immediately, with reset to the yellow-road arrival masterpiece. Camera presets: full arrival vista; road-level gate approach; gate plaza looking upward into towers; crystal palace and fountain close-up; rooftop garden bridge view; overhead city-and-countryside panorama.
- Compact controls: sunlight state (rain-cleared afternoon / golden arrival / luminous evening), city bustle, fountain and transit activity, and crystal-reflection intensity. Optional evening must preserve the road, gardens and architecture with warm illumination rather than turn the city dark.
- Never require a journey before reward: the famous destination is fully visible on frame one, and exploration uncovers detail rather than unlocking the view.

#### PERFORMANCE THAT PRESERVES MAGIC
- Reserve bespoke fidelity for the road foreground, monumental gates, central palace cluster, nearest gardens, fountains and public activity. Instance repeated tower ornament, windows, foliage, crowds, lamps, distant structures and road bricks with procedural variation.
- Use tiered city geometry, screen-space aware reflection detail and pooled motion systems for trams, flags, fountain droplets and citizens. Reduce remote tower interiors and far population before sacrificing hero gate and skyline craft.
- Target smooth navigation on a modern laptop, clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and keep the city luminous, densely built and explorable. The viewer should feel not that they saw an image of a destination, but that an impossible beloved world has suddenly opened in front of them.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - ARRIVAL IN A FUNCTIONING OZ
The city should feel as if the viewer has arrived during an ordinary dazzling day in a magical capital, with residents and transport pursuing routines beyond the camera. Do not use static green crowd confetti as a substitute for life.
- Populate the Yellow Brick Road with journeys: visitors approach the gates, gatekeepers greet and admit groups, residents leave toward markets, and small parties stop at fountains or look upward before continuing into the boulevard.
- Run city circulation visibly: emerald trams or carriages move between stops, market vendors arrange goods and serve passers-by, banners and glass ornaments react to breezes, and bridge pedestrians change direction or pause at overlooks.
- Build gentle magical cause-and-effect: fountains send sparkling droplets onto nearby paving, jewel-light shifts across moving figures, doors open for arrivals, birds or small fantastical creatures relocate when crowds pass, and tower transit lights show inhabitants moving vertically.
- Vary behavior across districts: arriving, greeting, shopping, commuting, performing briefly, resting and departing should make the city read as inhabited rather than a row of facades around a road.
Implement efficient stateful citizens, transit routes, scheduled stops and lightweight reactions while preserving the iconic hero vista. Even serene mode must retain moving journeys and social encounters; never freeze citizens into decorative silhouettes or animate everything with the same loop.

<summary><strong>13. Billion-Piece Lost Valley - The Living Dinosaur Sanctuary</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most astonishingly rich Three.js living dinosaur world imaginable: a vast protected lost valley where dinosaurs are not exhibits or monsters but living wildlife inside a complete primeval ecosystem. The opening view should hit like a dream made real: an elevated overlook across an emerald river basin filled with jungle, waterfalls, fern meadows, volcanic cliffs and misty mountain walls, while a colossal long-neck herd crosses the luminous shallows below, pterosaurs wheel through shafts of sun, and smaller dinosaurs move among cycads in the foreground. It must read immediately as an entire surviving dinosaur sanctuary, not a lone T-Rex, a fenced paddock, a theme-park gate, a chase game or an empty landscape with a few creatures dropped into it.

The goal is the impression of a billion pieces of living prehistoric detail. Every look should reveal more: textured scales and feathering, breathing flanks, blinking eyes, mud on feet, footprints filling with water, eggs hidden among plants, insects over puddles, fish scattering under dinosaur steps, bark, vines, orchids, fern spirals, mossy rock, wet leaves, river stones, distant nesting cliffs and entire layered herds. Achieve overwhelming visible density through procedural generation, instancing, pooled animation, merged terrain and level of detail, never by creating an impossible number of individual meshes.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate the terrain, creatures, plants, water, mist, materials, lighting and animation procedurally without external model or image assets. Use finely articulated voxel or micro-block construction where it makes vegetation, cliffs, nests and skin patterns feel handcrafted, while preserving convincing animal anatomy, beautiful flowing water and a lush natural-world silhouette.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE VALLEY ALREADY ALIVE
- Open directly on the complete sanctuary from a majestic bright overlook after warm tropical rain. No menu, scientific dashboard, loading reveal, helicopter arrival, fenced compound or waiting for an animal to enter view.
- The hero composition must show a full dinosaur society in one breathtaking image: immense sauropods wading through the central river; a triceratops family grazing on a near bank; small feathered dinosaurs darting through foreground ferns; pterosaurs above the falls; distant hadrosaurs moving in a ribbon across open meadow; one respectful, partly obscured predator silhouette far enough away to add wonder, not horror.
- The landscape itself must be unforgettable: turquoise river bends, multi-tier waterfalls descending from hanging cliffs, dense jungle canopy, sunlit fern plains, volcanic stone arches, drifting mist and a ring of immense green mountains sealing off the lost world.
- Make the scene beautiful and legible within a tenth of a second: sunlight, rich color, clear dinosaur silhouettes and huge scale cues. Never hide the achievement in darkness or chaos.

#### CREATURE DETAIL - WILDLIFE, NOT PLASTIC FIGURES
- Give each visible species characteristic shape, posture and motion: sauropods with slow weight shifts, tail counterbalance and water displacement; horned herbivores protecting calves; hadrosaurs in social groups; armored dinosaurs among low plants; tiny feathered species that pause, peck and sprint; pterosaurs that bank and land on distant cliffs.
- Nearby animals must reward close viewing with layered skin or feather patterns, muscle motion under the surface, wet highlights, nostril breath, eye movement, mud splashes, leaf brushing, scratches, healed marks and subtle individual color variations.
- Build natural behaviors rather than spectacle: drinking, grazing, bathing, grooming, nesting, juveniles following adults, herd calls shown through head turns, fish fleeing footsteps and dragonflies lifting from water.
- Keep predators believable and secondary: a distant large theropod drinking at a separated bank or moving between trees can create scale and reverence, but there is no attack sequence, blood, panic or arcade objective.

#### THE COMPLETE PRIMEVAL ECOSYSTEM
- Construct a valley with multiple visually connected habitats: broad river shallows for the hero herd, waterfall pools, fern meadow grazing grounds, deep jungle edges, cycads and giant tree ferns, muddy nesting flats, rocky high ledges for flying animals and distant mist forest.
- Make vegetation absurdly rich: layered canopy trees, palms, cycads, horsetails, giant ferns, broad wet leaves, moss, mushrooms, vines, orchids, fallen logs, root systems and hundreds of plant clusters with procedural variation and life-like movement.
- Water is a central masterpiece: clear shallow sections showing stones and fish, darker river channels, rippling reflections of dinosaur legs and jungle, expanding footprints, wakes from moving tails, waterfalls with spray rainbows, dripping cliff foliage and moisture hanging in sunbeams.
- Add countless tiny ecosystem signs: insects, frogs at pool edges, birds or early avian silhouettes, shed leaves, broken branches, egg fragments, dung-beetle-scale motion only if subtle, tracks crossing mud and distant flock movements that make the valley feel inhabited beyond the hero animals.

#### LIGHT, EMOTION AND EXPLORATION
- Default to brilliant morning light breaking through post-rain mist: emerald foliage, warm dinosaur hides, cool luminous water, golden spray and a sky opening beyond towering cliffs. The feeling is awe, protection and almost unbearable privilege at seeing a lost world alive.
- Allow immediate orbit, pan and zoom with reset to the complete valley masterpiece. Include camera presets for the overlook panorama, waterline beside the sauropod crossing, fern-level triceratops family, waterfall-and-pterosaur cliffs, nesting-ground view and a high map-like basin view showing the ecosystem as a whole.
- Meaningful compact controls only: ecosystem activity density, weather/light state, river level and mist, and a species-balance preset that changes which herds are emphasized while keeping the same valley. No fact panels, species labels or UI over the landscape by default.
- Animate gentle environmental life everywhere: breathing animals, waterfall flow, herd travel, pterosaur glides, leaf movement, mist curls, river ripples, insects, shifting shadows and occasional distant calls represented visually through flock and posture reactions.

#### EXTREME FIDELITY THAT REMAINS EXPLORABLE
- Spend bespoke geometry on the visible hero animals, foreground vegetation, waterfall rocks, river shallows and overlook plants. Use instancing and LOD for distant herds, canopy layers, grasses, ferns, insects and rock texture.
- Preserve giant animal silhouette, anatomy and water interaction at all quality levels; reduce far foliage layers, distant herd counts, mist samples and reflection precision first.
- Use efficient skinned or segmented animation systems, pooled footprints and splash decals, layered water shading, shared procedural plant materials and shadow budgets focused around the camera.
- Target smooth interaction on a modern laptop with devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The result must feel incomprehensibly detailed and alive, but it must open directly into wonder rather than collapse under its ambition.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - ANIMALS, NOT STATUES
This valley must behave like an ecosystem observed in progress. Dinosaurs cannot simply be beautifully modelled figures planted in hero poses; from the first frame they need motives, group dynamics, environmental response and varied movement.
- Give every visible herd a behavioral purpose: sauropods travel slowly toward water, adults feed while juveniles stay protected between bodies, hadrosaurs graze then lift their heads and redirect together, and smaller animals dart between cover and open riverbank.
- Make the hero animals act over time: a sauropod steps into shallow water and sends widening ripples outward; a triceratops family shifts around a calf, browses and responds defensively to a distant sound; pterosaurs circle thermals, descend toward ledges and launch again rather than orbiting forever at one altitude.
- Simulate ecology in readable chains: vegetation bends or depletes briefly where animals feed, mud takes footprints, drinking disturbs reflections, fish scatter from entering feet, insects lift from foliage, calls or motion cause nearby groups to look, cluster or retreat.
- Include variation and uncertainty: rest, browse, drink, walk, herd, guard young, splash, vocalize and change direction should be triggered on staggered schedules, not synchronized looping walk cycles or idle tail-wagging.
Use lightweight state machines, waypoint territories, herd steering, simple avoidance, procedural gait phases and LOD/instancing for distant populations. Even the lowest activity setting must show living behavior; never meet the brief with stationary dinosaur sculptures, frozen silhouettes or decorative creatures rotating in place.

<summary><strong>14. Billion-Piece Chocolate Factory Garden - The Impossible Confectionery World</strong></summary>

```text
Create a spectacular original Three.js chocolate factory garden world: an impossibly beautiful edible valley inside an immense glass-roofed confectionery works, where a warm chocolate river winds through candy orchards, biscuit bridges, caramel waterfalls and flowerbeds of delicate sweets, while the magnificent operating factory rises around and behind the garden with pipes, copper vats, glass galleries, delivery boats, turning machinery and tiny craft workers. It must instantly communicate the fantasy everyone wishes they could visit: a complete, joyous chocolate-making world one can see all at once, not a chocolate bar, a fountain, a small room or a generic factory interior.

The first frame should produce disbelief through overwhelming abundance and design: a garden valley of edible architecture embedded inside a colossal ornate factory conservatory. Every inch should appear considered, from patterned chocolate tiles and piped icing trim to candy leaves, sugar-crystal dew, cocoa sacks, brass gauges, tiny conveyor systems, glossy streams, wafer stonework and thousands of bright confections. Build the perceived billion-piece effect through dense reusable procedural systems, instancing and careful composition rather than literal uncontrolled object counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Create all geometry, materials, textures, fluid effects, machinery, figures, lighting and animation procedurally; do not use external assets. Use a premium handcrafted micro-voxel aesthetic for candy, brickwork, machinery, garden beds and architectural ornament, while making chocolate glossy and flowing, spun sugar translucent, caramel luminous and the total world irresistibly tactile.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE EDIBLE KINGDOM IN FULL OPERATION
- Open directly from a high garden overlook under a vaulted glass-and-brass factory roof, with the chocolate river sweeping from a caramel cascade in the background toward the foreground, crossed by an ornate biscuit-and-icing bridge and surrounded by dazzling edible botany.
- The surrounding factory must be immediately visible as a whole world: copper mixing towers, looping pipes, glass elevators, gantries, softly rotating gears, trays moving along overhead conveyors and glowing workshop windows encircling the garden.
- Include tiny human-scale activity from the start: elegantly costumed confectioners tending flowers, pushing ingredient carts, steering a small wafer boat on the chocolate river and arranging sweets on a bridge-side pavilion. Keep them original, warm and whimsical rather than imitating named characters.
- Default lighting is radiant golden morning pouring through the glass roof, illuminating steam, sugar dust and glossy chocolate reflections. No menu, dark tunnel, build sequence or delayed river reveal.

#### THE GARDEN THAT LOOKS EDIBLE IN EVERY DIRECTION
- Fill the valley with extraordinary botanical invention: candy-cane trunks with marzipan leaves, gumdrop topiary, striped lollipop flowers, fondant roses, sugar-glass lilies, berry jelly bushes, spun-sugar willow branches, cocoa-pod groves, nougat stepping stones and wafer terraces planted in precise color harmonies.
- Build the ground with rich variation: chocolate-soil planting beds, crushed-cookie paths, mosaics of tiny candies, caramel puddles, cream borders, peppermint gravel, icing filigree fences and benches shaped like carefully baked biscuits.
- Make the river central and luxurious: thick flowing chocolate with folds, sheen and reflected gold roof trusses; caramel side streams; marshmallow foam where water would churn; wafer boats leaving slow glossy wakes; dipping platforms and sculpted chocolate river walls.
- Extend the edible environment into multiple discoveries: a praline greenhouse, a towering cake pavilion, a truffle grove, a jelly-bean nursery, a sugar-crystal grotto and a distant chocolate waterfall backed by pipework and brass service walkways.

#### THE FACTORY AS A COLOSSAL LIVING PALACE
- Surround the natural fantasy with an awe-inspiring operating confectionery factory: Victorian-inspired glasshouse arches, copper vats the size of houses, ornate brass valves and gauges, polished pipes carrying chocolate and cream, steam vents, mechanical whisks, cooling galleries, packaging balconies and ingredient silos beautifully integrated into the garden walls.
- Close views should reveal impossible workmanship: rivets, pipe joints, pressure dial needles, engraved copper, transparent tubes containing moving candies, chocolate streaks on ladles, rotating moulds, stamped wrapper stacks, flour dust, patterned tile floors, tiny warning lamps and illuminated recipe boards without readable branding.
- Make manufacturing motion mesmerizing rather than industrially harsh: candy streams arc into trays, pralines align on conveyors, ribbons curl, biscuits stamp in rhythm, wrapped sweets tumble softly into carts and glass lifts climb between levels.
- The factory may be enormous, but it should feel safe, elegant and joyous, with gardens thriving inside it rather than threatened by it.

#### STORY, MATERIAL AND DELIGHT
- Populate the world with many tiny readable stories: gardeners dusting sugar flowers, a childlike visitor group glimpsed safely on a glass gallery, confectioners testing a caramel cascade, a delivery boat passing below the bridge, a worker trimming a towering cake terrace and a flock of delicate sugar-butterfly automatons moving among flowers.
- Make materials almost physically tempting: deep glossy dark and milk chocolate, amber translucent caramel, frosted pastel candies, crystalline sugar, matte cookie crumb, golden biscuit, polished copper, curved glass, soft steam and brightly patterned wrapping-paper accents.
- Use animated light and motion to multiply richness: roof shadows shifting over the valley, sugar particles glittering in shafts of light, steam curling from vats, chocolate surface ripples, gears turning, leaf-like sweets swaying and reflected machinery moving through glossy river folds.
- Keep the emotion pure delight and abundance. No hazards, villains, grotesque food behavior, obstacle courses, branded franchises or gameplay replacing the vista.

#### EXPLORATION AND IMPOSSIBLE-DENSITY ENGINEERING
- Provide immediate orbit, pan and zoom with reset to the entire edible valley and factory-roof hero view. Camera presets: full conservatory kingdom; chocolate river boat-level vista; candy garden macro path; biscuit bridge view; copper-vat factory gallery; caramel waterfall; overhead factory-and-garden plan.
- Meaningful compact controls only: factory bustle, chocolate flow richness, light state (gold morning / sparkling afternoon / lantern-lit gala), and garden palette season (spring pastels / summer fruit / winter peppermint). Every transformation must remain gorgeous and instantly readable.
- Put maximum geometry and shader attention into the river, bridge, hero candy plants, caramel waterfall, copper machines and closest figures. Instance flower families, candies, pipes, roof trusses, distant workers, conveyor contents and garden paving with controlled variation.
- Use scalable fluid surfaces and particles rather than costly simulation; reduce distant candy population, far machinery motion and roof reflection resolution before removing the tactile near-world details.
- Keep it smooth on a modern laptop, clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and deliver the feeling of an edible world made from countless tiny miracles, already operating at the moment the page opens.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - A FACTORY AND GARDEN AT WORK
The edible valley must operate like a miraculous place with ongoing production and inhabitants carrying out tasks, not an ornate confectionery stage with motionless workers.
- Create connected production routines: ingredients arrive on carts, workers inspect plants, harvest candy fruit, carry baskets to conveyor inputs, monitor copper vats, package finished treats and return along alternate paths; conveyors and pipe valves respond to those activities.
- Give the river traffic purpose: small wafer boats follow chocolate channels, slow at a loading dock, take on cargo and depart; caramel falls create ripples and foam, floating sweets drift into collection grates and mechanical arms periodically retrieve them.
- Make garden life respond: oversized leaves sway and bounce as workers pass, butterflies relocate between flowers, sprinklers or sugar mist activate in zones, and visitors pause to marvel before continuing through biscuit bridges and paths.
- Establish asynchronous detail everywhere: gears turn at related but non-identical rates, steam releases follow vat states, lights signal batches, and agents choose tasks rather than merely walking identical circuits.
Use simple job queues, route networks, stateful instanced workers/boats and event-driven factory animation. Keep the first frame beautiful and readable, but always visibly functioning; avoid stationary figure clusters, decorative conveyor loops disconnected from activity or random motion without cause.

<summary><strong>15. Billion-Piece Grand Budapest - The Entire Alpine Resort at Its Peak</strong></summary>

```text
Create the ultimate high-detail Three.js living world inspired by the Grand Budapest Hotel at its glorious peak: not simply the pink hotel facade, but an entire exquisitely composed alpine resort radiating around it, including the towering symmetrical hotel, funicular line and stations, terraced gardens, snowy mountains, village streets, period vehicles, arriving guests, bustling forecourt, glowing lobby glimpses, dining rooms, service routes and hundreds of tiny coordinated stories. The first frame should feel like opening a vast handcrafted cinematic jewel box whose every compartment is alive.

This must be extravagantly beyond an ordinary hotel miniature. The viewer should perceive billions of considered details: facade mouldings, balcony rails, red roof ornaments, windows, curtains, chandeliers, luggage, brass carts, flower arrangements, snowy footprints, funicular cables, station signs, fir needles, pastries, taxis, awnings, village roofs, mountain paths, smoke curls and light in innumerable rooms. Use procedural systems, instancing, compact animations and level of detail to create the appearance of obsessive craftsmanship while keeping the entire resort explorable.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate architecture, figures, vehicles, snow, landscaping, interiors, mountains, lighting and animation procedurally without external image or model assets. Adopt a precision micro-voxel dollhouse craft language with perfectly clean silhouettes, rich pastel color and extraordinary tactile detail.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE COMPLETE CINEMATIC RESORT
- Open immediately on an immaculate elevated three-quarter vista: the enormous pastel-pink hotel centered above the resort, a red funicular climbing from the foreground village station toward its grand entrance, terraced gardens and snowy roads unfolding below, alpine peaks and fir forest framing the background.
- The hotel must remain iconic and dominant, but the composition should already be dense with life: period taxis and luggage carts in the forecourt, guests crossing terraces, funicular passengers visible through windows, warm lobby light, smoke from service chimneys, bright awnings, snow sparkle and tiny village movement.
- Provide selective transparent-window or dollhouse-depth glimpses of interior richness while protecting the perfect pink exterior silhouette. The viewer sees the lobby chandelier, concierge desk and perhaps restaurant glow as rewards within the grand full-world image.
- Default to crisp luminous winter morning after fresh snow: pink and red against white, deep green firs, blue mountain shadows and warm golden interiors. No introductory typography, slow reveal or empty hotel before guests arrive.

#### THE HOTEL AS AN OBSESSIVE MASTERPIECE
- Construct the complete facade with dense symmetrical articulation: layered pink wings, white trim, window grids, balconies, rails, entrance canopy, hotel lettering as crafted architectural signage, cupolas, chimneys, red roof planes, terrace balustrades, awnings, flags, planted urns and elegant stairways.
- Make close inspection astonishing: lightly weathered paint, window glazing and curtains, brass handles, lamps, roof snow caps, gutter icicles, ornate moulding, terrace tiles, footprints, luggage tags suggested by color, flower petals and staff uniforms with tiny readable silhouettes.
- Build interior glimpses with luxury: patterned floor, grand staircase, lifts with indicators, chandelier clusters, red carpet, concierge keys, lobby furniture, pastry boxes, dining salon tables, flower displays and staff circulation visible through selected windows or a tasteful cutaway toggle.
- Every line of the hotel should communicate impeccable service and comic perfection; never degrade into a generic resort block or chaotic fantasy castle.

#### THE FUNICULAR, VILLAGE AND MOUNTAIN WORLD
- Give the funicular a full satisfying journey visible from the hero camera: twin cars passing on rails, cable line, snow-edged tracks, ornate lower and upper stations, waiting guests, lamps, timetables as graphic accents and luggage being transferred toward the entrance.
- Build a compact but complete resort settlement below: colorful roofs, pastry shop window, station square, period taxis, delivery vans, snow-cleared streets, stair lanes, lamps, planted boxes, small hotel-associated buildings and a road winding into fir-covered slope.
- Surround it with a magnificent alpine landscape: layered fir forests heavy with snow, rocky peaks, cable or path hints only if elegant, sculpted snowdrifts, distant chalets, sunlight on ridges and atmospheric depth into the mountains.
- Make the grounds richly manicured even in winter: patterned terrace gardens, clipped shrubs shaped under snow, fountains or statues, service courts hidden gracefully, walking guests and staff maintaining perfect order.

#### LIFE IN PERFECT CHOREOGRAPHY
- Start at peak-season bustle already running beautifully: doormen welcome a car, bellboys roll luggage, concierge silhouettes move behind lobby windows, the funicular climbs, a pastry delivery enters the service route, guests take photographs on terraces and dining salon tables glitter in preparation.
- Populate the resort with many gentle stories: a child watching the funicular, porters navigating snowy steps, staff clearing one neat path, a couple reaching the terrace viewpoint, bakers carrying boxes, flags catching mountain breeze and evening option revealing a formal arrival gala.
- Use motion like clockwork rather than chaos: elevators, doors, luggage carts, taxis, funicular, steam curls, falling snow powder, moving curtains, fireplace glows and window silhouettes repeat elegantly on distinct rhythms.
- Do not turn this into a game, a mystery plot or a text-heavy film tribute. The world itself is the astonishing performance.

#### EXPLORATION, COLOR AND PERFORMANCE
- Enable orbit, pan and zoom immediately with reset to the full hotel-and-resort hero view. Presets: complete alpine vista; forecourt arrival; funicular ride perspective; lobby-window close-up; terrace-and-mountain view; village station; high map-like resort composition.
- Compact controls: season (glittering winter / blooming alpine summer), resort tempo (quiet morning / peak arrivals / gala), interior-depth toggle and light state. Each mode must look deliberately art-directed, never muddy or empty.
- Use luxurious materials: dusty and saturated pink plaster, cream mouldings, scarlet roof detail, brass, glass, velvet-like interior shading, lacquered vehicles, powder snow, dark firs, pastry colors and high blue sky.
- Prioritize bespoke geometry on the hotel facade, entrance activity, funicular, nearest terrace, station and interior glimpses; instance windows, snow-laden trees, guests, roof tiles, luggage, background houses and lamps. Scale distant population and trees before touching hotel detail.
- Clamp devicePixelRatio to 2 and target smooth motion. The world should appear built by an impossible army of patient artisans and already functioning flawlessly the instant it opens.

#### LIVING WORLD SIMULATION - A HOTEL IN OPERATION
The resort must function like a grand hotel during its glorious peak, with staff, guests and transport conducting overlapping routines. Avoid a beautiful facade fronted by stationary bellhop and guest markers.
- Run hotel arrival stories: the funicular climbs, unloads guests, accepts luggage and departs; taxis or cars stop briefly under the entrance canopy; doormen greet arrivals; bellhops collect cases and traverse lobby or terrace routes before returning.
- Make hospitality readable through action: guests stroll terraces, take tea, enter doors, lean at mountain viewpoints and move on; waiters serve tables and clear them; lobby silhouettes cross, pause at a desk and ascend via visible lift or stair cues.
- Animate the resort network: smoke or steam changes with service cycles, flags and awnings shift in alpine breeze, village deliveries arrive, skiers or walkers trace distant paths where season permits and windows illuminate in staggered occupied patterns.
- Let interactions create consequences: doors open for approaching guests, luggage carts change routes around people, funicular stations briefly accumulate passengers and snow or wet paving records movement.
Implement lightweight task/state systems for guests, staff, vehicles and funicular service, with varied schedules and LOD. The hotel may feel composed and elegant, but it must never feel paused, populated by blobs or limited to one endlessly repeating transport loop.

<summary><strong>16. Billion-Piece Ancient Egypt Civilization Build-Out</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximal Three.js Ancient Egypt civilization build-out across the Nile, from river settlement to pyramid construction, with the scale and density of a living historical epic. The first frame should be overwhelming: the Nile flood glitters through fields and villages, boats haul stone from quarries, ramps spiral around a rising pyramid, rope teams drag blocks, scribes track work, oxen move sledges, smoke rises from kilns, temples and workshops line the river, desert cliffs glow gold, and thousands of tiny coordinated actions make the civilization feel alive. This must not be a single pyramid, a tomb corridor, a sandboard game, or a generic desert. It is a whole river civilization organizing water, labor, stone, food and ritual into monuments.

Push detail at every layer: irrigation channels, shadufs, reed boats, mudbrick houses, granaries, cattle pens, palm groves, papyrus marshes, pottery wheels, bread ovens, copper tools, quarry marks, sled tracks, ropes, ramps, limestone casing blocks, worker camps, market stalls, temple pylons, banners, dust, floodwater, star-calendar markings, measuring rods, scaffolds, boats docking, people carrying baskets, overseers, children, animals and moving shadows. Use procedural settlement systems, instanced crops/workers/boats, modular pyramid blocks, crowd LOD, water shaders, dust particles and animated logistics routes.

Make time itself the control. A scrubber should transform early settlement into irrigation network, quarry expansion, block transport, pyramid rise, casing-stone finish, temple processions and completed plateau. Camera modes: god-view Nile map, river boat, quarry face, ramp-side construction, worker camp, temple ceremony and sunset overview. Controls should visibly affect era, flood level, labor density, construction progress, dust, wind, boat traffic and camera. The default frame must already show a massive connected system: Nile, fields, quarry, boats, ramps, pyramid and people all in motion. Keep it historically grounded, bright, legible and huge.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles. Prioritize dynamic spectacle and concrete construction over explanatory UI. If a feature is mentioned, make it visible, moving or inspectable.

<summary><strong>17. Hyper-Fidelity Voxel Simulation Spec - Giza Plateau (Old Kingdom Prime)</strong></summary>

```text
#### OBJECTIVE

- Construct a "Hyper-Fidelity" Voxel Simulation of the Giza Plateau at the height of the Old Kingdom.
- The scene must be awe-inspiring, featuring the Pyramids in their original pristine state (polished white limestone with solid gold capstones), a lush, living Nile river delta, and the Great Sphinx.

---

#### VISUAL TARGET

- This is not a "ruin" simulator. This is Ancient Egypt in its prime.
- The resolution must be high enough to distinguish individual palm fronds and the architectural setbacks of the temples.
- Daytime lighting must not feel flat or dull-maintain strong cinematic contrast (especially on the pyramids) and keep the Nile looking vibrant and "alive" across all times of day.

---

#### USER CONTROLS

- **Camera:** Cinematic Orbit with smooth damping.
- **Lighting Control:** On-screen buttons for Dawn / High Noon / Golden Hour / Starry Night + a Cycle button. (Keyboard shortcuts optional fallback, not required.)
- **Tour Mode:** On-screen button to toggle an auto-flyover following the causeway from the Nile to the Great Pyramid.
- **Default lighting preset:** Golden Hour.

---

#### WORLD GENERATION LAYOUT (West to East)

#### The Deep Desert (Background)

- **Topography:** Rolling, undulating sand dunes (use noise functions for height). NOT a flat plane.
- **Color:** Deep gold/orange sand.

#### The Plateau (Mid-Ground)

#### The Great Pyramids (3 Main, several Queens')

- **Geometry:** Massive scale. Use a stepped-voxel algorithm but at a high density so the slopes appear smooth from a distance.
- **Placement:** Ensure the main pyramids (and Queens' pyramids) are clearly separated with non-overlapping footprints and readable spacing.
- **Material:** Polished White Limestone (Main body) + Solid Gold Pyramidions (The top capstone must shine/emit light).

#### The Great Sphinx

- Must be positioned accurately guarding the causeway.
- High-detail voxel modeling for the paws, nemes headdress, and face.
- Painted details (traces of red/blue) if possible.

#### The River Valley (Foreground)

- **The Nile River:** A wide, flowing body of water.
- **Water Effect:** Voxel blocks must use a translucent blue/green palette with a shimmer animation and convincing specular/reflection so it doesn't look dull.
- **Vegetation Belt:** EXTREMELY DENSE placement of Date Palms and Papyrus reeds along the banks.
- **The Harbor:** Stone quays where boats (simple voxel barges) are docked.

---

#### ARCHITECTURAL DETAILS (The "Impressive" Factors)

- **Causeways:** Long, covered stone corridors connecting the Valley Temples (at the river) to the Mortuary Temples (at the pyramid base).
- **Obelisks:** Tall, needle-like spires placed at temple entrances, tipped with gold (electrum) to catch the light.
- **Civilization:** Small clusters of mud-brick worker houses near the river to show scale.

---

#### ATMOSPHERE & LIGHTING

- **The "Ra" System:** The sun must be the dominant force.
- **High Noon:** Blinding white light, short shadows, the limestone pyramids should look almost glowing white (avoid a dull/flat look-use cinematic fill/reflection to keep form and sparkle).
- **Golden Hour:** Long purple shadows, the sand turns deep orange, the gold tips sparkle (this should be the default).
- **Night:** Dark blue sky, torchlight (orange point lights) flickering at the temples.
- **Reflections:** If possible in the render budget, approximate the reflection of the Pyramids in the Nile.

---

#### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- **Output:** Full implementation.
- **Engine:** Three.js (inlined via Import Map) or raw WebGL2.
- **Performance Strategy:**
  - InstancedMesh is Mandatory: You must instance the "Sand Voxel," "Water Voxel," and "Palm Tree Voxel." Do not draw 100,000 individual meshes.
  - Matrix Transformation: Use matrix manipulation to scale the Pyramids without killing memory (one giant pyramid made of instanced blocks, or a single procedural mesh).
  - Occlusion: Do not render the inside of the pyramids.
- **Color Palette:** Use a rich, saturated palette. Avoid "muddy" default colors.
  - Gold: Hex #FFD700 (High specular).
  - Limestone: Hex #F0F0E0 (High brightness).
  - Nile: Hex #2E8B57 (Deep green/blue).

---

#### IMPLEMENTATION GUARDRAILS

- **No External Assets:** All textures/models must be code-generated.
- **Solid Geology:** The sand dunes must mesh seamlessly with the river banks. No gaps in the world.
- **Planning:** Ensure the Sphinx is not buried in a dune; flatten the terrain specifically where buildings are placed.
- **UI:** Keep the on-screen HUD minimal and functional (no extra commentary text).

---

#### FINAL INSTRUCTION

- Generate the full output.
- Focus heavily on the contrast between the lush green riverbank and the stark, blinding white/gold perfection of the Pyramids.
- Make the scale feel "Monumental."

<summary><strong>18. Billion-Piece Roman Empire Expansion</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most ambitious Three.js Roman Empire expansion scene possible: a living 3D Mediterranean where roads, armies, cities, ports and aqueducts visibly spread from Rome over time. The first frame must be a spectacular atlas come alive: a relief map of the Mediterranean fills the view, Rome glows at the center, roads extend like veins, legions march with standards, ships cross sea lanes, frontier forts rise, aqueducts assemble arch by arch, ports fill with cranes, towns light up and campaign arrows move across mountains, rivers and coasts. This must not be a single Colosseum, a voxel city, a flat map or a toy battle. It is empire as motion, infrastructure and geography.

Push the detail beyond normal map scenes: stone road segments, milestones, marching dust, legion tents, standards, siege engines, bridges, aqueduct channels, town grids, forums, baths, walls, villas, farms, harbors, cranes, ships, mountain passes, river crossings, smoke from camps, border glows, trade routes, city lights, tiny workers, wagons and armies that read at both close and far scale. Use instanced armies, road pieces, ships, towns, arches and terrain details; LOD for cities and units; shader overlays for borders, campaigns and trade; and clear visual hierarchy so it remains readable.

Make the expansion interactive and cinematic. Timeline phases: early Republic, Italy consolidation, Punic conflict, eastern expansion, Gaul, Egypt, imperial consolidation and frontier pressure. The user can toggle roads, armies, cities, ports, aqueducts, borders, trade routes and campaign labels, then dive from atlas view to road-level as legions march past. Camera modes: full Mediterranean atlas, Rome center, legion road view, naval route, aqueduct construction, frontier fort and victory procession. Default frame: the whole Mediterranean alive with roads, ships, armies and cities growing from Rome. Spectacle first, but structured enough to understand in one second.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles.

<summary><strong>20. Pompeii — The Last Morning</strong></summary>

```text
Create a Three.js historical spectacle of Pompeii on the morning of the eruption: a bright, bustling Roman town in full life with the Bay of Naples sparkling beyond — and Vesuvius opening into its towering umbrella column as the viewer scrubs time forward. This must stay luminous and awe-driven throughout: the spectacle of the column, the strange beauty of the falling ash, the human story told with dignity at distance — never gore, never black murk. Open on the living town thirty minutes before the eruption, streets full. No title screen, menu, loading state, or ruined-city start.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: one timeline slider across the most famous morning in history — a living town, a mountain awakening, and light that changes meaning.

#### THE LIVING TOWN
- Build Pompeii bright and specific: the forum with temple colonnades, market stalls under awnings, thermopolium counters with embedded jars, fountains at crossroads, wheel-rutted stone streets with stepping stones, courtyard houses glimpsed through doors, painted facades and election slogans as colored bands, gardens and vineyards at the edges.
- People with routines everywhere: bakers, water carriers, children, dogs, porters, a school group, harbor traffic on the blue bay. Vesuvius stands green and pastoral above it all.

#### THE TIMELINE
- One master scrubber across about three hours: tremors ripple awnings and topple an amphora; birds leave in flocks; the mountain cracks a white plume that climbs into the colossal pine-tree column, sunlit on one side, shot through with lightning flickers; day shifts to bronze as the veil spreads; pumice begins to fall like gray snow, gathering on rooftops; people gather belongings and stream toward the harbor in lamplit groups under a glowing amber sky.
- Every stage must remain spectacular and legible: the column is the hero — vast, layered, beautiful and terrifying; the falling ash catches light; lanterns and the column glow keep the final stage luminous rather than dark.
- Scrubbing backward restores the morning perfectly — the slider is a time machine, not a one-way movie.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero forum view with Vesuvius framed at the street end. Presets: rooftop panorama of column over town, harbor view back at the coastline and mountain, street-level among the evacuation, and a distant bay view of the full umbrella cloud.
- Controls: the time scrubber with play and speed only. Tiny HUD: time since first tremor. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced town and crowds, the column built from layered billowing shader volumes kept efficient, ash as budgeted particles with accumulation maps, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning far town before the column or forum. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>21. Knossos — Bull-Leaping Day</strong></summary>

```text
Create a Three.js spectacle of Minoan Knossos on festival day: the great central court of the labyrinthine palace packed with spectators as athletes perform the legendary bull-leap — rendered with the fresco palette of the Minoan world, ochre reds, sea blues, saffron and lily white, so the whole scene feels like the palace walls come to life. Open directly mid-festival with a leap about to begin. No title screen, menu, loading state, or empty court.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the most mysterious ritual of the Bronze Age, staged in the palace that named the labyrinth — beauty, danger and ceremony in fresco color.

#### THE PALACE
- Build Knossos with its signature architecture: red downward-tapering columns, light-wells, grand staircases, stacked porticoes, horns-of-consecration on the rooflines, magazines with giant pithoi jars, and corridors hinting at the labyrinth beyond.
- Dress the walls with living frescoes — dolphins, lilies, processions — and let the festival echo them, with real figures matching painted ones.

#### THE LEAP
- Stage the bull-leap as a stylized, repeating ceremonial arc, protected from realism risk by the fresco aesthetic: the great bull charging in a measured line, the leaper seizing the horns and arcing in the iconic fresco pose over its back, spotters catching the landing, garlands thrown. One simple trigger — Next Leap — runs the sequence again with small variations: different athlete, different vault, an occasional heart-stopping stumble recovered by the catchers.
- Between leaps the court breathes: the bull wheeled and calmed by handlers, athletes saluting the priestess on the tripartite shrine balcony, the crowd rippling.

#### THE MINOAN WORLD
- Complete the setting: olive and cypress hills, the road to the harbor with arriving processions bearing offerings, saffron gatherers on a terrace, ship sails on the distant Aegean, doves around the light-wells.
- Brilliant Aegean light, fresco saturation everywhere — this should look like no other prompt in the vault.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero court view down the leap line. Presets: barrier-level beside the charge, shrine-balcony view with the priestess, grand-staircase view across the court, and a rooftop panorama over palace and hills to the sea.
- Controls: the leap trigger and a crowd-density slider only. Tiny HUD: leap count. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced crowd and architecture modules, fresco-style shading shared across materials, LOD hills, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning hills and far crowd before the court or the bull. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>22. Thebes — Festival of Opet on the Nile</strong></summary>

```text
Create a radiant Three.js reconstruction of ancient Thebes during the Festival of Opet: the sacred barques of Amun carried from Karnak amid incense and song, gilded river barges towed along the Nile, and the temple avenues lined with sphinxes and thousands of celebrants. Open directly inside the festival at full brightness — procession moving, river glittering, banners alive. No title screen, menu, loading state, or empty temple.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: Egypt beyond the pyramids — a living capital of gold, ochre and water on its greatest day.

#### THE TEMPLE CITY
- Karnak is the anchor: massive pylons with painted reliefs, the hypostyle forest of papyrus columns glimpsed through gates, obelisks with gold-leaf tips firing in the sun, flag masts with streaming pennants, the avenue of ram-headed sphinxes running toward Luxor temple in the haze.
- Paint the architecture as it was: columns and reliefs in ochre, turquoise, lapis and white — color everywhere, weathered just enough to feel real. Close inspection must reward with hieroglyph bands and relief figures.

#### THE PROCESSION AND THE RIVER
- The barque procession is the moving heart: priests in white linen bearing gilded boat-shrines on poles, fan-bearers, chantresses with sistrums, dancers, offering tables, incense smoke drifting through sunbeams.
- On the Nile, the great river barge of Amun gleams in gold and is towed by rowing boats with rhythmic oars; feluccas and reed skiffs crowd the margins; the west-bank cliffs and mortuary temples shimmer across the water.
- The crowd is a city's worth: families on rooftops, vendors with bread and beer jars, children chasing, scribes recording, soldiers keeping the route, cattle garlanded for offering.

#### EGYPTIAN LIGHT
- Hard clean desert sun mediated by river sparkle and linen whites: gold, ochre, turquoise and green palm belts against blue sky and bluer water. Relentlessly bright and alive.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero view down the sphinx avenue as the barques pass. Presets: pylon gate close-up, rooftop crowd view, riverbank view of the towed barge, and west-bank panorama back across the Nile to the whole city.
- One simple mode: Falcon Over Thebes — an automatic slow aerial circuit from Karnak along the avenue and over the river, no controls. Plus a procession-progress scrubber. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced columns, sphinxes, crowds and boats; LOD beyond the festival axis; devicePixelRatio clamped to 2; quality selector thinning distant city before temples, barques or river. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>23. Babylon — Akitu New Year at the Ishtar Gate</strong></summary>

```text
Create a magnificent Three.js reconstruction of Babylon at its absolute peak during the Akitu New Year festival: the Processional Way thronged with celebrants passing through the Ishtar Gate, the ziggurat Etemenanki rising over the city, and the terraced Hanging Gardens cascading green against blue-glazed walls. Open directly inside the festival at golden afternoon — procession already moving, crowds already roaring silently in gesture and color. No title screen, menu, loading state, or empty streets.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the most famous lost city alive for one day — lapis, gold and a river of people.

#### THE GLAZED CITY
- The Ishtar Gate is the hero artifact: deep lapis-blue glazed brick with golden aurochs and dragon reliefs in raised tiers, crenellated towers, glaze that catches sun like ceramic. At close range the brickwork, relief animals and color borders must reward inspection.
- The Processional Way runs as a grand axis: lion reliefs striding along both walls, banners, palm-lined margins, the crowd flowing between.
- Etemenanki dominates the skyline in stepped tiers with a ramped ascent; the Hanging Gardens terrace nearby pours vines and trees down its levels with visible water channels glittering — engineering and paradise at once. The Euphrates crosses the scene with reed boats and barges.

#### THE FESTIVAL
- Stage the procession as a readable river: priests bearing the golden statue platform, musicians with drums and lyres, dancers, incense smoke threads, nobles under canopies, commoners pressing at the edges, children on shoulders.
- Fill the city beyond the axis with life: rooftop watchers, market stalls of dates and pottery, water carriers, scribes, donkeys, cooking smoke, gardens on courtyard houses.

#### LIGHT OF MESOPOTAMIA
- Late golden light on glaze and mudbrick, saturated blues against warm ochres, palm greens, the river flashing. Bright, festive, jewel-like.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero view down the Processional Way through the Gate toward the ziggurat. Presets: gate close-up among the crowd, Hanging Gardens terrace view, ziggurat summit panorama over the city, riverside view with barges.
- One simple extra mode: Bird Over Babylon — a slow automatic aerial drift along the processional axis and around the ziggurat, no controls needed. Plus a procession-progress scrubber. Compact collapsible UI; tiny HUD naming only the current preset.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced crowds, bricks-by-texture not geometry, LOD city blocks beyond the axis, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning far city before the Gate, gardens or procession. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>28. Kyoto — Gion Matsuri at Lantern Dusk</strong></summary>

```text
Create a glowing Three.js scene of Kyoto during the Gion Matsuri: a towering yamaboko float — a wooden mountain hung with tapestries and a forest of paper lanterns — hauled through a machiya street by rope teams, musicians playing on its upper deck, the whole city out in yukata under a violet dusk. Open directly mid-procession with the float already moving and lanterns already lit. No title screen, menu, loading state, or empty street.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: a thousand-year festival at the magic hour — lantern light, moving architecture and a street full of stories.

#### THE FLOAT
- Build the yamaboko as moving architecture: massive wooden wheels taller than people, carved beams, brocade tapestry panels with procedural patterns, the high mast, rows of chochin lanterns glowing warm, musicians seated on the upper gallery with flutes and bells, the conductor riding the prow with folded fans signaling.
- It must creak forward believably: rope teams of dozens leaning into the pull in rhythm, wheel turns at corners staged as the famous skidding pivot on wet bamboo, attendants steadying with poles.

#### THE STREET AT DUSK
- The machiya canyon glows: latticed wooden facades, second-floor balconies of watchers, paper lanterns strung overhead, food stalls with steam and glow, festival-goers in yukata with uchiwa fans, children with goldfish bags, a shrine gate at the street end.
- Sky in deep violet and apricot afterglow; first stars; warm lantern pools on the stone street. Luminous, never dark.

#### SMALL STORIES
- A child lifted to see, a stall-keeper fanning skewers, an elder bowing to the float, photographers in modern silhouette kept absent — this is the timeless version; let every figure read as part of the festival.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero three-quarter street view of the float aglow. Presets: rope-team level looking up the mast, upper-balcony view across lantern lines, deck view beside the musicians, and a rooftop view down the procession route.
- One simple mode: Walk With the Festival — the camera drifts alongside the float at procession pace on a fixed path, no controls. Plus a dusk-depth slider (sunset through blue hour). Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced crowds and lanterns, baked-feeling warm light via economical point lights and emissive maps, LOD facades, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning far crowd before the float or lantern glow. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>29. Serpent Over Tenochtitlan — The Island Capital</strong></summary>

```text
Create a breathtaking Three.js flight over Tenochtitlan at its height: the Aztec island capital spread across Lake Texcoco — causeways striking out over blue water, canals threading white districts, chinampa floating gardens in green grids, smoke rising from the Templo Mayor — seen from a slow glide above. Open directly in flight approaching the city across the lake, the whole vista already alive below. No title screen, menu, loading state, or ground start.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the Venice of the Americas from the air — a lost city so orderly and alive it stuns, explored by the gentlest glide.

#### THE ISLAND CITY
- Build the urban fabric at convincing density: whitewashed adobe blocks with rooftop gardens, canal grid busy with canoes, plazas, schools and noble courtyards, the great market of Tlatelolco swarming with thousands of tiny traders under awnings.
- The sacred precinct anchors the center: the twin-staired Templo Mayor with its two shrines trailing copal smoke, surrounding temples and the circular wind-god tower, banners and feather standards, a ceremony in progress read from altitude as color and motion.
- Causeways run to the mainland with steady streams of porters and travelers; aqueduct lines glint; the lake holds reed beds, fishing canoes with nets, and waterbirds lifting in flocks.

#### THE VALLEY OF MEXICO
- Ring the lake with reality: shoreline towns, maize terraces, pine slopes, and the two snow-crowned volcanoes standing over everything in clear air.

#### LIGHT OF THE HIGH VALLEY
- Crisp high-altitude morning: intense blue sky and lake, brilliant whites, green chinampa stripes, ochre temples with painted accents. Saturated, clean, monumental.

#### THE GLIDE
- The single interaction is the foolproof glide: constant gentle speed, mouse steers heading and height within soft limits, automatic banking, no stall or crash — drifting low simply floats the camera over rooftops. An eagle companion occasionally slides alongside.
- Reset returns to the lake-approach hero view. Presets: Templo Mayor circling pass, canal-level drift between districts, market overview hover, causeway run to the mainland gate, and a grand high circuit of the whole island. Auto-tour toggle flies everything hands-free.
- Tiny HUD: altitude only. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced buildings, canoes and crowds with strong LOD bands by altitude, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector simplifying far shore before the island core. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>30. Pillars of Zhangjiajie — Glide Through the Mist</strong></summary>

```text
Create a majestic Three.js world of the Zhangjiajie stone forest: hundreds of impossibly tall sandstone pillars crowned with pines, rising out of rivers of drifting mist, with the viewer already airborne among them. Open directly in flight between two great pillars, mist parting below, sunlight raking across rock faces — no title screen, menu, loading state, or ground-bound start.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate all terrain, rock, vegetation, mist and light procedurally; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the world that inspired floating mountains — explored by the gentlest possible flight.

#### THE STONE FOREST
- Build pillars with real geological character: banded sandstone strata, sheer faces, ledges holding gnarled pines, vines and ferns on shaded sides, white rock scars where light hits. Vary heights and groupings so canyonscapes form natural corridors and amphitheaters.
- Mist is a living layer, not fog soup: rivers of cloud flowing between pillars, tearing on edges, pooling in basins, with clear sunlit air above. Pillars should emerge and vanish as mist drifts.
- Stage famous human touches small and far: a glass skywalk bridging two summits, a cable car sliding along its line, a winding stair carved into one face, tiny hikers for scale.

#### LIFE AMONG THE PILLARS
- Macaques scrambling on a ledge, cranes crossing the void, swifts spiraling around summits, a waterfall threading from a cleft into the mist below, pine branches moving in the wind.

#### LIGHT AND AIR
- Morning light, golden on east faces, cool blue in shadowed canyons, mist glowing where sun strikes it; saturated greens; bright and crystalline throughout.

#### THE GLIDE
- The single interaction is a foolproof glide: constant gentle airspeed, mouse steers heading and pitch within soft limits, automatic banking, no stall, no collision punishment — drifting near a wall simply eases the camera away. Flying must feel like a crane, not a fighter jet.
- Reset returns to the hero corridor. Presets: summit-skimming pass, deep-canyon mist run, skywalk flyby, and a high circling overview of the whole stone forest. An auto-tour toggle flies the route hands-free.
- Tiny HUD: altitude only. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced pines and rock detail, LOD by distance, layered mist planes or volumetric-feeling shaders kept cheap, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector reducing far pillar detail before near rock or mist. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>32. Wreck the City - Demolition Physics Playground</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js interactive demolition playground: a dense, sunlit, fully detailed downtown district built specifically to be destroyed - and un-destroyed - with spectacular, physically convincing structural collapse. The player swings a crane-mounted wrecking ball, places demolition charges, and triggers chain collapses; a slow-motion button turns disasters into ballet; a rewind control runs every collapse perfectly backwards until the city stands whole again. This must not be a flat gray physics sandbox, three breakable boxes on a plane, a dark apocalyptic scene, or a UI-heavy engineering tool. It is the guilty pleasure of knocking things down, given a whole gorgeous city.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces - and the point is that the pieces COME APART: facades that shed bricks individually, floors that pancake, glass curtain walls that shatter into glittering sheets, water towers that tumble and burst, dust that rolls down streets in billowing walls. Achieve it with structural-joint simulation over instanced debris, not naive per-brick physics for the whole city at once.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE CITY, PRISTINE, WAITING
- Open on a bright, colorful, fully detailed downtown block cluster in morning light: a beaux-arts stone bank, a red-brick warehouse row, a glass office tower, a mid-rise with a rooftop water tower, a parking structure, street furniture, parked cars, trees, billboards - beautiful enough that destroying it feels deliciously transgressive.
- The wrecking crane already towers over the district with the ball hanging ready, gently swaying. A subtle highlight pulses on the ball: the invitation is instant and obvious.
- The district is safely evacuated but not dead: barriers ring the site, warning lights blink, a small crowd of hard-hatted spectators watches from behind fences at a safe distance, pigeons occupy the rooftops (they flee dramatically on the first impact).
- No menus, titles, tutorials or reveals - one glance communicates everything.

#### DESTRUCTION PHYSICS - THE ENTIRE POINT
- Buildings are built as genuine structural assemblies: columns, beams, floor slabs, facade panels and connection joints with strengths. Damage propagates: knock out corner columns and the corner sags, cracks race, then the corner peels away; take enough and the whole structure pancakes with floors slamming down in sequence.
- Materials fail differently and must read instantly: brick sheds as individual tumbling units and chunks; stone cracks into heavy slabs; glass curtain walls craze then shatter into sparkling instanced shards; steel bends and screeches (visually - kinked members); concrete crumbles with rebar exposed; the water tower ruptures with an actual water burst that washes debris.
- Debris is a first-class system: bouncing, sliding, settling into believable rubble piles that persist, throwing dust on impact; large pieces crush cars flat and snap trees.
- Dust and smoke are cinematic: rolling collapse clouds that surge down streets and slowly settle, backlit by the sun for maximum drama, never blackening the scene.
- Chain reactions are the jackpot: a falling tower can lean into its neighbor and take it down; the parking structure can collapse floor by floor; scripted-feeling spectacle from honest simulation.

#### THE TOOLS
- Wrecking ball: fully player-controlled crane rotation, cable length and swing momentum - skillful swings matter; the ball has real mass, cable physics, and satisfying follow-through into facades.
- Demolition charges: place up to a handful on structural members with a clear placement mode, then one big red plunger fires them in sequence with staged sub-second delays - the classic implosion, doable by hand.
- Slow motion: a prominent button (and hold-to-slow) dropping time to 10 percent with the camera free to fly through the frozen bloom of glass and dust.
- REWIND: the hero feature. A large rewind control runs recorded destruction perfectly backwards - debris leaping from the ground, dust inhaling, floors un-pancaking, glass reassembling into sheets - until the district is pristine. Scrubbing the timeline back and forth mid-collapse must work and is itself the best toy in the box. Implement by recording simulation state snapshots; make it flawless over at least the last 60 seconds of activity.

#### SCORING WITHOUT BUREAUCRACY
- No menus or mission text: a minimal, playful readout tallies tonnage dropped, chain-reaction multipliers, style bonuses (clean implosion into own footprint scores headline praise from the spectator crowd, who cheer and raise phones).
- The crowd reacts to everything: ducking at big impacts, cheering good collapses, scattering pigeons.

#### LIGHT AND FIDELITY
- Bright morning sun, saturated materials, glittering glass, warm brick and cream stone: the prettier the city, the better the destruction. Dust clouds glow amber against the light.
- Every building rewards close inspection BEFORE destruction: cornices, window frames, fire escapes, rooftop clutter - detail that then becomes debris rather than vanishing.

#### CONTROLS AND CAMERA
- Orbit, pan and zoom immediately, plus a smart action camera toggle that frames the current collapse cinematically; reset restores the hero overview (rewinding separately restores the city).
- Compact controls only: tool selector (ball / charges), slow-mo, rewind/timeline, action-cam toggle, and a reset-city button that plays the full rebuild-rewind as its animation.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Structural simulation runs at coarse joint level; visual debris is instanced and pooled with LOD (near debris full 3D, far debris imposters); dust via layered shader volumes; sleeping bodies aggressively managed.
- Quality selector reduces debris counts, dust resolution and far detail before ever compromising collapse believability, slow-mo smoothness or rewind fidelity.
- Smooth on a modern laptop through a full multi-building collapse, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most satisfying destruction toy on the web - and the undo makes it endless.

<summary><strong>33. Clear-Air Cockpit - Alpine Full-Panel Flight Simulator</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js general-aviation flight simulator in perfect weather: a faithful single-engine light aircraft (Cessna-172 class) cruising in crystal-clear alpine morning air, with a complete, working, beautiful instrument panel filling the lower frame and a breathtaking clear view of the Alps - glaciers, ridgelines, valleys, lakes and villages - filling the windshield. This is the opposite of a storm-landing drama: the spectacle is clarity, fidelity and the pure joy of flight over magnificent terrain. It must not be an arcade ring course, a toy dashboard with fake gauges, an exterior-only flyby, or a hazy low-detail terrain. It is the most realistic cockpit view in the collection.

The goal is extreme fidelity in both directions at once: inside, a panel whose every instrument works and can survive full-screen inspection; outside, terrain so detailed and sunlit that every glance out the window is a poster. Use procedural generation, instancing and terrain LOD with discipline.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - ALREADY FLYING, ALREADY GLORIOUS
- Open mid-flight, straight and level at about 8,500 feet on a golden-clear morning: the panel lit by sun, the yoke gently alive, the propeller a shimmering translucent disc, and through the windshield a colossal glaciated massif (Matterhorn-class silhouette) slightly right of the nose, with a deep green valley, a turquoise lake and a village far below.
- Everything is already working: needles alive with subtle jitter, gyros settled, engine note implied by airframe vibration, wingtip visible in the left window, sun glinting off the cowling.
- No menus, loading screens, title cards or setup - hands-on-yoke from the first second.

#### THE PANEL - INSTRUMENT FIDELITY AS THE STAR
- Build the classic six-pack with true behavior: airspeed indicator (correct arcs and needle lag), attitude indicator with a properly geared artificial horizon that matches the outside world exactly at all times, altimeter with Kollsman window and correct triple-needle logic, turn coordinator with ball responding to yaw and slip, heading indicator that precesses slightly, and vertical speed indicator with realistic lag.
- Surround them honestly: tachometer, fuel gauges that slowly deplete, oil temperature and pressure, ammeter, engine controls (throttle, mixture, carb heat) with animated levers, elevator trim wheel that visibly moves and matters, flap switch with staged indicator, magneto/master switches, a working analog clock, and a compass in its fluid rocking with turns.
- Add a small GPS/nav display with a live moving map of the terrain below - the map must actually correspond to the world.
- Materials and craft: brushed panel metal, worn screws, glass over instruments with faint reflections of the pilot-side window light, sun flare crossing gauge glass in turns, yoke and pedals animating with control input, checklist card clipped to the yoke.
- Every instrument must be genuinely readable and correct enough that a pilot would nod: this is the fidelity showpiece.

#### THE WORLD - THE ALPS IN PERFECT LIGHT
- Build a vast alpine terrain with honest structure: a hero glaciated peak group, serrated ridgelines with sun-and-shadow interplay, hanging glaciers with crevasse banding, scree slopes, treeline transition into dense instanced conifer forest, alpine meadows, waterfalls threading cliff faces, a turquoise lake with sun glitter, and a valley floor with villages, church spires, roads with moving vehicles and a small airstrip.
- Distance is the luxury: visibility unlimited, ridge behind ridge fading through blues to a far horizon, no murk - the classic post-cold-front alpine clarity.
- Living details at cruise altitude scale: cloud shadows from scattered fair-weather cumulus drifting over slopes, a cable car crawling up a ridge, a paraglider wheeling below, birds, another light aircraft passing far off on an airway, smoke from a valley chimney rising straight in calm air.
- The sun must interact constantly with the scene: glacier faces blazing, lake glitter path, cockpit shadows moving across the panel in turns.

#### FLIGHT MODEL - REAL-FEELING, WELCOMING
- Implement honest light-aircraft dynamics: lift versus airspeed and angle of attack, stall with buffet cue and gentle wing drop, coordinated versus uncoordinated turns visible in the ball, trim actually relieving stick load, power changes causing pitch tendencies, and altitude affecting engine performance subtly.
- Default to a stability-assisted mode that keeps the aircraft honest but forgiving; a REALISM toggle removes assistance for full hand-flying.
- Controls: mouse-yoke or arrow keys plus throttle, trim, flaps and rudder keys, all discoverable from a compact overlay; gentle turbulence over ridgelines (mountain air is alive even on clear days), thermals over sunny faces that nudge the VSI.
- Flight is free: no rings, no missions. Suggested joys placed in the world: fly the lake shoreline, cross the glacier saddle, circle the summit, descend the valley to overfly the airstrip, chase your own aircraft shadow across a meadow.

#### CAMERA AND VIEWS
- Default is the pilot-eye cockpit view with the full panel; smooth head-look with mouse (panel stays believable at all angles), plus quick views: left window wing view, over-the-nose scenic, and one external chase camera that reveals the beautifully modeled aircraft (correct strut-braced high wing, registration painted on, control surfaces visibly deflecting with input, sun on the spinner).
- A photo mode hides UI and frees the camera around the flying aircraft.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Terrain uses concentric LOD with silhouette-perfect distant ridges; forests, buildings and vehicles instanced; the panel renders at bespoke maximum quality always - instruments never degrade.
- Quality selector reduces terrain shading richness, forest density and cloud shadow resolution before ever touching panel fidelity or horizon correctness.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the clearest, calmest, most fidelity-obsessed cockpit on the web - flight as pure scenery and craft.

<summary><strong>34. Manhattan Cutaway - The Living Ant Farm</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js cutaway of one dense Manhattan block, sliced clean like an architectural section drawing and running like a living ant farm: subway trains sliding through tubes below, foundations gripping bedrock, basements, steam mains and sewers layered like strata, elevators climbing inside towers, dozens of lit interiors stacked floor over floor, and the street with taxis and pedestrians running right along the cut edge. This must not be a dollhouse with three rooms, a static diagram, a low-poly schematic or a dark cross-section. It is the hidden vertical machinery of a real city, all working at once.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: rebar in the cut concrete, brick courses, duct runs, cable trays, tunnel rings, platform tiles, apartment furniture, office desks, boiler rooms, water tanks, and the geological banding of the bedrock itself. Achieve this with extreme visible detail, instancing and disciplined LOD, not raw geometry counts.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE CITY OPENED LIKE A BOOK
- Open directly on the completed section: a straight-on, slightly elevated view of the cut face, composed like the world's most detailed architectural drawing brought to life. Above ground: a mid-rise pre-war building, a sliver tower, and a corner of a glass office block, all sliced open. Below ground: two stacked subway lines, a station platform with waiting passengers, utility layers, foundations and deep glowing-cool bedrock.
- The cut face must be immediately, unmistakably alive: a train pulling into the platform, elevators mid-climb, people moving on stairs, steam drifting from a main, taxi headlights crossing the street edge.
- Bright and readable: warm interior light spilling from dozens of rooms, clean daylight on the street level, cool tones below ground but never murky. Every layer legible at one glance, endless on inspection.
- No menus, labels, titles or reveals.

#### THE SECTION CUT - CRAFT OF THE SLICE
- The cutting plane is razor clean and shows honest construction: sliced floor slabs with rebar dots, brick wythes, steel columns in section, insulation layers, tile thickness on bathroom walls, tunnel cast-iron rings, granite bedrock with veins and seams.
- Give the cut faces a subtle unified treatment (a faint blueprint-like tint on cut surfaces) so structure reads instantly, while everything behind the cut is fully rendered, colored and lit.
- The slice must include a satisfying variety of building anatomy: lobby, stairwells, elevator shafts with visible counterweights, mechanical floors, a rooftop water tower with internal water level, basement laundry, parking, a bank vault, and street vaults under the sidewalk.

#### BELOW THE STREET - THE REAL SPECTACLE
- Two subway levels: an upper local line with a station (platform, columns, turnstiles, ads suggested as color panels, waiting passengers, arriving and departing trains with correct deceleration, door cycles and passenger exchange) and a deeper express tube where trains pass in a rush of light.
- A utility stratum that is beautiful in its density: steam mains wrapped in insulation venting occasional wisps, water and gas lines, electrical duct banks, a sewer with visible flow, telecom bundles, all color-coded and physically routed around each other.
- Foundations as heroes: caisson piers and spread footings gripping the rock, older rubble foundations beside modern concrete, a slurry wall, and the bedrock itself with layered banding, seams and a forgotten dry well.
- Below-ground life: track workers with headlamps in a side gallery, a rat or two (this is honest Manhattan), drips, signal lights changing, a maintenance train parked on a siding.

#### ABOVE THE STREET - STACKED LIVES
- Fill the sliced floors with dozens of distinct, furnished interiors that reward zooming: apartments with kitchens, plants, bookshelves and televisions flickering; offices with desks and meeting rooms; a dance studio; a doctor's waiting room; a corner diner at street level with counter seating; a boiler room; a super's workshop.
- Populate with autonomous inhabitants at readable scale: cooking, meetings, a cello practice, elevator queues, a dog waiting at a door, roof access for a smoke break by the water tower. Figures are stylized but individually varied and purposeful.
- Elevators, stairs and building systems visibly work: cabs and counterweights moving, stair users, water tank level, steam risers warming radiators.
- The street layer stitches worlds: pedestrians, taxis and a bus crossing the cut edge, a delivery hand-truck entering the freight entrance, a sidewalk grate exhaling subway air as a train passes beneath - timed together.

#### DYNAMISM AND SYSTEM COUPLING
- The joy is watching systems interconnect: a train arrives below, a pulse of passengers rides escalators up and disperses into the lobby and street; evening deepens and windows warm up floor by floor; the diner gets busy; steam venting increases.
- Include a day-night cycle control that transforms the section: morning outflow, midday hum, evening return, late-night skeleton activity with the express trains still running.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Camera slides parallel to the cut face by default (a beautiful lateral dolly with zoom), plus free orbit within sensible limits so the viewer can look into rooms at an angle without going behind the section.
- Presets: full-section hero view; platform level as a train arrives; utility stratum close-up; mid-tower apartment stack; rooftop and water tower against the sky.
- Compact controls: time of day, section depth (slide the cutting plane a few meters deeper into the block, re-slicing rooms and tunnels live - this is a showpiece), activity density, photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Bespoke detail nearest the default camera; instanced furniture, figures, pipes, rebar, tiles and windows; merged shells for the deep background of the block behind the cut.
- Quality selector reduces interior prop density and far figures before ever sacrificing the cut-face craft, the trains or the elevator motion.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the ant farm you cannot stop watching.

<summary><strong>35. London Toy Train Table — Bright Voxel Rail Loops Through Famous Icons</strong></summary>

```text
Create a dream toy-railway version of London in Three.js: a bright voxel train-table world where little red trains and Tube-like carriages weave through the capital's most famous landmarks. It should feel like the ultimate playroom train set, but with excellent London recognizability.

If you use Three.js, add an import map (before the module script) mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Never reuse identifiers in the same scope - use descriptive variable names.

#### TABLE SETUP
- Let the city sit on a visible playtable or wooden base so the toy-train format is obvious.
- Use elevated tracks, short viaducts, tidy tunnels, and small station platforms.
- The overall layout should be readable from a slightly top-down three-quarter camera.

#### LANDMARKS
- Include Elizabeth Tower / Westminster, Tower Bridge, the London Eye, St Paul's, The Shard, and Battersea.
- Landmarks should be tightly packed around the tracks so trains constantly pass recognizable icons.
- Add small parks and river sections to stop the table feeling too crowded.

#### TRAINS + TRACKS
- Run multiple train loops at once: classic bright-red toy trains, Tube-inspired trains, and maybe a tiny DLR-style shuttle.
- Use branching points or track switches that visibly reroute trains.
- Add a few cutaway tunnel sections so the train movement is easy to follow.

#### STYLE
- Keep everything crisp, bright, and toy-clean.
- Red, blue, yellow, and fresh green should dominate rather than grey realism.
- No dark station lighting, no smoky atmosphere, and no heavy grime.

#### CONTROLS
- Track-switch toggles.
- Train count / speed slider.
- Tunnel cutaway toggle.
- Follow-train camera plus a reset overview.
- Camera presets: full table, bridge crossing, station close-up, tunnel slice.

#### TECHNICAL
- Instanced sleepers, rails, trees, windows, and repeat props.
- Keep train motion smooth and predictable.
- Target >=55 FPS and clamp devicePixelRatio <= 2.

<summary><strong>36. London Brick Mega Playset — All Landmarks in One Bright Toy City</strong></summary>

```text
Create a bright, high-detail Three.js voxel / toy-brick London mega playset where the city's most famous landmarks all live together in one irresistible miniature capital. It should feel like the dream family-attraction version of London: packed, colorful, cheerful, and instantly readable from the first frame — not moody, rainy, or dark.

If you use Three.js, add an import map (before the module script) mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Never reuse identifiers in the same scope - use descriptive variable names.

#### HERO VIEW
- Default camera: elevated three-quarter overview with the whole playset visible immediately.
- London must read within one second: Elizabeth Tower and the Palace of Westminster, the London Eye, Tower Bridge, St Paul's, The Shard, Buckingham Palace, Battersea Power Station, and a clear Thames route.
- Fill the frame with city; avoid large empty margins or distant skyline haze.

#### LANDMARK SET
- Compress the geography for beauty and legibility rather than realism.
- Every landmark should keep a clean, unmistakable silhouette even at toy scale.
- Stitch the city together with bridges, pocket parks, plazas, little streets, and visible waterfront edges.

#### BRIGHT TOY STYLE
- Use dense voxel or brick-built geometry with polished toy materials.
- Default to cheerful daylight: blue sky, soft white clouds, clean shadows, bright greens in the parks, vivid reds on buses, and sparkling blue water.
- Do not drift into muddy greys, heavy fog, or cinematic black levels.

#### LIFE
- Red buses, black cabs, tiny Tube trains, cyclists, riverboats, pigeons, and small crowds should already be moving on load.
- Let the London Eye rotate slowly and allow Tower Bridge to lift occasionally for a boat passage.
- Add little flags, trees, and waterfront details so the model feels loved and alive.

#### CONTROLS
- Orbit camera with a strong reset hero angle.
- Landmark labels toggle.
- Traffic density slider.
- Boat / train activity toggle.
- Camera presets: full city, Westminster, river corridor, skyline close-up.

#### TECHNICAL
- Use instancing or merged geometry for repeated blocks, windows, trees, and vehicles.
- Keep water simple and bright rather than physically heavy.
- Target >=55 FPS and clamp devicePixelRatio <= 2.

<summary><strong>37. Thames Loop Toy Island — Compact Voxel London on a Single Tabletop</strong></summary>

```text
Create a bright Three.js voxel London as a single compact tabletop island, with the Thames looping around and through the island like a toy-blue ribbon. The whole thing should feel like a premium model-island attraction: playful, polished, and immediately recognizable.

If you use Three.js, add an import map (before the module script) mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Never reuse identifiers in the same scope - use descriptive variable names.

#### TABLETOP COMPOSITION
- Show the island sitting on a clean plinth or playtable base so the miniature format is obvious.
- The river should carve the composition into elegant loops with several bridges crossing it.
- Keep the island compact enough that the viewer can understand the whole world from one hero view.

#### LANDMARK CLUSTERS
- Group Westminster, the South Bank, Tower Bridge, St Paul's, The Shard, and Battersea into tight readable clusters.
- Add Buckingham Palace and a compact green park zone for extra instant recognition.
- Rearrangement is fine as long as each cluster feels clearly London.

#### COLOR + MATERIAL
- Use bright, toy-clean materials: crisp blue water, warm stone blocks, fresh grass, red buses, black cabs, and cheerful roof colors.
- Make the default lighting sunny and high-key.
- Avoid gloomy skies, wet roads, murky river water, or desaturated palettes.

#### MICRO-MOTION
- Tiny boats should circle the water loop.
- Mini trains or Tube-like carriages should slip across short viaducts or dive into neat cutaway tunnels.
- Add ducks, trees, flags, and little animated crowds for family-attraction charm.

#### CONTROLS
- Orbit camera and rotating-plinth toggle.
- River traffic slider.
- Labels or highlight mode for landmark clusters.
- Camera presets: full island, river loop, bridge view, skyline edge.

#### TECHNICAL
- Prioritize silhouette clarity over fine map accuracy.
- Use instancing for vegetation, windows, and repeating blocks.
- Target >=55 FPS and clamp devicePixelRatio <= 2.

```text
Create a bright, color-coded voxel London in Three.js where the major landmark clusters each use a strong cheerful color family, making the whole city feel playful, clear, and instantly legible. This should be unmistakably London, but with the joyful readability of a premium toy block world.

If you use Three.js, add an import map (before the module script) mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Never reuse identifiers in the same scope - use descriptive variable names.

#### CITY READ
- Use an elevated overview that shows the whole compact city at once.
- The Thames should tie everything together through the center.
- London should be obvious from silhouette alone before the viewer notices the color system.

#### COLOR SYSTEM
- Give each landmark cluster a clear family without losing realism entirely: Westminster warm gold and red, the South Bank teal and coral, the City cool blue, Tower Bridge bright sky-blue accents, Battersea mint or cream, parks vivid green.
- Keep the palette clean, saturated, and cheerful.
- Avoid muddy mixing or dark cinematic grading.

#### LANDMARKS
- Include Big Ben / Westminster, the London Eye, Tower Bridge, St Paul's, The Shard, Battersea, and Buckingham Palace.
- Keep each form crisp and readable despite the stylization.
- Add bridges, little squares, and train lines to stitch the colored districts together.

#### MOTION
- Red buses, black cabs, boats, and trains should all move continuously.
- Add a few bright balloons, banners, or flags for extra liveliness if they do not clutter the frame.
- The first frame should already feel busy and sunny.

#### CONTROLS
- Saturation slider.
- District highlight toggle.
- Traffic density slider.
- Camera presets: full city, Westminster cluster, river corridor, skyline edge.

#### TECHNICAL
- Use instanced blocks and repeat props heavily.
- Prioritize legibility, silhouette, and crisp color separation.
- Target >=55 FPS and clamp devicePixelRatio <= 2.

<summary><strong>42. Ride the Firework</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of BEING the firework: the viewer rides the shell from inside the mortar - launch, the trembling climb through darkness with the city shrinking below, the heart-stop instant of the burst, and then the impossible part: the camera IS the bloom, hanging at the center of an expanding cathedral of ten thousand golden streamers as they unfurl, curve, crackle and die around you - then falling softly with the embers as the next shell whistles past on its way up. This must not be a fireworks display watched from a park, a particle demo, a single camera shake, or a menu of effects. It is the four most violent and beautiful seconds in entertainment, experienced from the only impossible seat - inside - and looped into an endless, varied, ecstatic show.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion sparks with real structure: every star of the shell an individual tracked ember with its own trail ribbon, gravity arc, flicker decay and smoke thread - so the bursts read as ARCHITECTURE the camera sits inside, not as screen-space sparkle. Achieve this with instanced ember-and-ribbon systems and staged burst choreography.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - IN THE TUBE
- Open in near-darkness inside the mortar tube: a circle of night sky directly above, the fuse glow flickering warm on the steel walls, faint crowd-glow bleeding over the tube lip - one full second of held breath. Then IGNITION: a floor of white-gold fire, the walls streak, and the camera is thrown upward into the night.
- The launch must be felt in pure image: violent initial acceleration easing into the climb, the lifted-charge flame roaring beneath (glancing down shows the sparking tail and the mortar flash receding), the harbor city unfolding below - promenade crowds as glittering dots, reflections on black water, other shells rising in the distance on glowing threads.
- The climb takes about three seconds and is tuned like music: the roar visually fading, the spin slowing, the apex approaching with a hush - the shell coasts, the city glitters far below, the stars are suddenly close - and the burst charge fires. No menus, titles or reveals; the show begins at ignition.

#### THE BURST - THE IMPOSSIBLE SEAT
- The instant of detonation is staged in three readable beats even at full speed: the FLASH (one frame of blinding gold filling everything); the SHOCK-SPHERE (a translucent pressure ring racing outward through the smoke); and the BLOOM - ten thousand tracked embers erupting radially past and around the camera, each dragging a luminous ribbon trail, the camera left floating at the exact center of an expanding golden sphere.
- Inside the bloom is the experience's reason to exist: streamers curving into gravity's comb in every direction, the sphere's inner surface glittering and breathing, crackle-stars popping in nested micro-bursts, smoke veils catching the light from within, the city visible THROUGH the falling curtain of gold below - hold this moment in gentle slow-motion (twenty seconds of dilated time for four real seconds of firework) so the viewer can turn and drink it.
- Ember physics must be honest and gorgeous: individual flicker frequencies, color temperature cooling from white-gold through amber to dying red, trails thinning, the whole constellation decelerating into the drift - and then the fall: the camera descends softly among the last embers and smoke threads as they wink out over the water.

#### THE SHOW - AN ENDLESS VARIED CYCLE
- Each launch is a different shell, cycling through the real pyrotechnic repertoire so no two rides repeat: golden willow (the classic long-droop cathedral); chrysanthemum (perfect dense sphere of color-shifting stars); palm (thick rising trunks bursting into fronds); crossette (every star splitting into four in a second generation of bursts AROUND the camera - the most spatially astonishing one); ring shell (a flat expanding halo the camera sits in the center of, like Saturn); strobe shell (the sphere blinking in synchronized silver); and a grand finale every several cycles - a triple-break shell whose three successive bursts nest inside each other with the camera at the heart of all three.
- Between rides, a two-beat breather: drifting down through smoke with the crowd-glow rising, the next mortar flash below, the whistle of the ascent beginning again - the loop must feel like a show with rhythm, not a repeated clip.
- The world below is a real scene, not a backdrop: a harbor festival - promenade and bridge crowds (instanced, upturned faces as warm dots), moored boats, a ferris wheel, the whole city strobing in each burst's light with correct flash-lag darkness between - and every previous shell's smoke lingering as slowly drifting strata the next launch climbs through.

#### DYNAMISM AS THE ENTIRE MEDIUM
- There is no idle state anywhere in the loop: tube-glow, launch violence, climb tremble, coast hush, triple-beat burst, bloom drift, ember death, smoke fall, next whistle - a continuous choreography where even the quietest beat (the apex hush) is motion. Camera work is part of the pyrotechnics: subtle spin during climb, the burst's pressure nudge, the fall's gentle sway - always smooth, never nauseating.
- Time dilation is the one hero control: a slider from real-time (violent, four seconds) to deep slow (the bloom as a full minute of navigable golden architecture) - at deep slow the viewer can FLY within the frozen-ish burst, moving among the streamers like a swimmer in a chandelier; this is the mode screenshots will live in.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- The ride runs itself from the first second (the default is the composed loop with free-look); a free-fly toggle unlocks full movement inside blooms; reset returns to the tube for a fresh launch.
- Presets: the tube; apex hush; bloom center; inside the crossette second generation; the ring-halo seat; below-the-willow looking up through the golden droop; the promenade crowd view for one full shell (the only outside seat, included for contrast).
- Compact controls only: time dilation, shell type (or auto-cycle), launch cadence, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Embers and ribbon trails fully instanced with lifetime pooling; burst choreography precomputed per shell type at load; the city as merged geometry with instanced crowd dots lit by a per-burst flash uniform; smoke as layered billboards.
- Quality selector reduces ember counts, trail lengths and smoke layers before ever sacrificing burst choreography, time-dilation smoothness or the launch sequence.
- Smooth on a modern laptop through the densest finale, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: everyone has watched ten thousand fireworks; this is the first one anyone has been.

## Living Art Worlds

<details>
<summary><strong>43. Billion-Piece Michelangelo Marble Awakening</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most ambitious possible Three.js Renaissance sculpture transformation: a giant block of Carrara marble in a chaotic workshop being carved into a living human figure in real time. The opening frame must be shocking and intimate at once: the marble block dominates the room, a half-freed body is emerging from it, one arm still trapped in raw stone, the chest half-polished and faintly breathing, chisel strikes send chips and dust outward, sunlight cuts through airborne powder, assistants haul ropes, pulleys strain overhead, plaster studies and anatomy drawings surround the room, broken marble fragments cover the floor, and the figure's eyes are just beginning to open beneath translucent stone. This must not be a static statue viewer, a quiet museum pedestal, a generic stone shader or a polite art-history vignette. It is dead stone becoming human through violent craft.

Push material detail to the limit: marble veins running through the body, rough quarry crust, blockout planes, chisel scars, tooth-chisel grooves, polished skin, powder in creases, broken chips, dust plumes, wooden mallets, iron chisels, ropes, hoists, wedges, scaffold planks, plaster casts, pinned sketches, measuring calipers, workbench clutter, footprints in dust, cloth covers, candle stubs, window light, hand marks and tiny fragments skittering across the floor. The transformation must be visible in one glance and inspectable up close: raw block to rough figure to refined anatomy to polished living stone. Use morph targets, displacement, procedural chisel marks, translucent marble shaders, dust particles, instanced chips, cloth and rope movement, and localized cracking around emerging limbs.

Make the workshop itself participate. Chisels should strike in rhythmic bursts, chips should fly, dust should roll through sunbeams, ropes should tighten, assistants should move as silhouettes, sketches should flutter, the figure should breathe, fingers should flex, cracks should travel through stone, and polished marble should warm subtly toward living skin while still retaining veins and stone edges. Provide a time scrub: raw block, first violent cuts, trapped figure, anatomical reveal, polished awakening and half-marble living finale. Camera modes: macro chisel impact, sculptor-eye view, full workshop orbit, x-ray marble-vein view, side-light anatomy view and cinematic awakening shot. Controls should visibly change carving progress, strike intensity, dust density, window light, marble translucency, living-stone blend and camera mode. The default must already be the peak image: half-human figure bursting from stone, chips midair, workshop alive, sunlight and dust making the transformation impossible to miss.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles. Prioritize dynamic spectacle and concrete construction over explanatory UI. If a feature is mentioned, make it visible, moving or inspectable.

<summary><strong>44. The Golden Realm - Klimt's Kiss and the Tree of Life</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of Gustav Klimt's golden universe: The Kiss as a monumental gilded colossus on its flower cliff, the Tree of Life growing its black spirals across the horizon, and an infinite radiant gold atmosphere in place of a sky - the whole world made of gold leaf, shimmering mosaic tesserae and living pattern. This must not be a flat picture on a wall, a small statue in a room, a yellow-tinted scene, or a static tableau. It is Klimt's gold period as a place: a luminous realm where the material itself performs.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion pieces of gold: individually glinting tesserae, drifting flakes of gold leaf, patterned fabric fields in constant slow motion, and a meadow of thousands of enamel flowers. Achieve this with procedural pattern shaders, angle-dependent micro-glitter and heavy instancing - the style IS the material.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE KISS, EXACTLY, THEN THE SCALE
- Open with the camera framing the couple precisely as the painting composes them: the embracing pair wrapped in their merged golden robe, kneeling on the flower meadow that breaks off into gold, her face serene in profile with closed eyes, his head bowed and turned away, the whole image drenched in gold ground.
- Palette and pattern fidelity are non-negotiable: his robe's field of black, white and silver rectangles; her dress's scattered circles and oval blooms in violet, blue, orange and green; the halo of golden vine-tendrils around them; the meadow's dense flowers; the warm gold haze behind. The faces are Klimt's own solution - mostly concealed, stylized, porcelain-serene; keep them exactly so and let the robes carry the drama.
- Hold the painting for a breath. Then the first movement reveals the truth of scale: the couple is a COLOSSUS - fifty meters of gilded monument - and the camera is a drone drifting near the hem of a robe the size of a cathedral facade. The composition was not a picture; it was a view from a distance. No menus, titles or instructions.

#### THE COLOSSUS - MATERIAL AND MOTION
- The robes are the subject and they must be alive: his rectangle field slowly CASCADES within the fabric like dark rain drifting down a golden river, individual rectangles gliding, occasionally aligning into columns and dispersing again; her circles and blooms slowly orbit and breathe, patterns migrating gently across the cloth. The fabric itself barely moves - the PATTERNS move within it, exactly the uncanny life the paintings imply.
- Surface truth: layered gold - matte gold ground, brighter burnished paths, and mosaic tesserae zones where thousands of tiny instanced facets each catch light at their own angle, so the colossus SPARKLES progressively as the camera moves around it. This angle-dependent glitter is the signature material effect; make it gorgeous and everywhere.
- The tendril halo around the couple grows perpetually: fine golden vines curling outward, blossoming, dissolving into leaf-flake sparks, regrowing - a slow golden fire that never repeats.
- Close approach must survive: a single square meter of robe should reveal tesserae edges, gold leaf micro-wrinkles, pattern pieces as slightly raised enamel inlays with their own specular life.

#### THE GOLDEN REALM - A WORLD WITHOUT SKY
- There is no sky and no horizon line - the world hangs inside an infinite luminous gold atmosphere: layered depths of warm radiance, slow drifting currents of brighter shimmer, and gold leaf flakes falling everywhere forever like softest snow, catching light as they tumble.
- The flower meadow is a full landscape, not a strip: thousands of instanced Klimt flowers - flat enamel daisies, forget-me-not clusters, trailing vines - in his exact meadow palette, carpeting a cliff that breaks off in a clean edge into the gold void below. Wind moves across the meadow in visible waves; petals occasionally lift and join the gold-leaf drift.
- On the far horizon-that-is-not-a-horizon, the TREE OF LIFE grows in real time: colossal black spiral branches curling outward across the gold, kilometers away, budding smaller spirals, hosting Klimt's little stylized birds; it grows continuously through the whole experience, never finished, its silhouette one of the most recognizable patterns in art.
- Between meadow and tree, sparse floating islands of pattern drift slowly - fragments of Klimt's other gold-period fields (eyes-of-Horus triangles, checkerboards, waves) as translucent golden banners in the atmosphere, giving the deep space life without clutter.

#### DYNAMISM AS DOCTRINE
- Nothing in this world is ever still: patterns migrate, tesserae glitter crawls with every camera move, gold leaf falls, tendrils grow, meadow waves roll, the tree curls outward, atmosphere currents drift, and the light itself slowly breathes between warm noon-gold and deep honey-gold on a long cycle.
- All motion is SLOW and stately - the realm is serene, not busy. A screenshot must look like Klimt; a minute of watching must feel like the painting dreaming.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate free drift-flight with gentle inertia plus orbit fallback; reset returns to the exact painting composition. Presets: the painting view; the robe hem close-up looking up the full height of the colossus; her profile at intimate distance framed in tendrils; the meadow cliff edge with flowers pouring over into the void; the long view across the gold to the Tree of Life; inside the falling gold-leaf drift with the couple soft in the distance.
- Compact controls only: light cycle position, gold-leaf density, growth speed of the tree, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Pattern motion in shaders (cheap, resolution-independent); tesserae as instanced facets with distance-collapsing LOD into micro-glitter normal maps; flowers, leaf flakes and tendrils instanced; the tree as procedurally growing tube spirals with merged mature sections.
- Quality selector reduces flake density, tesserae counts and meadow density before ever sacrificing pattern motion, glitter response or first-frame fidelity.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most opulent surface in art history, turned into weather, architecture and world.

<summary><strong>45. Starry Night - The Painted Universe</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of Van Gogh's The Starry Night in which the painting is only the first frame of an infinite painted universe. The experience opens as a pixel-faithful reproduction of the most famous night sky in art - and the first camera movement shatters the flatness: the sky has depth, the swirls are three-dimensional rivers of moving paint, and the viewer can fly off the hillside INTO the sky, deeper and deeper, without ever reaching an end. This must not be a textured skybox, a flat shader wobble, a diorama of the village with a static painted backdrop, or a particle screensaver. It is the discovery that the painting continues inward forever.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion living brushstrokes: every stroke an individual three-dimensional ribbon of thick paint with direction, body and glow, all of them in perpetual motion. Achieve this with instanced stroke geometry driven by flow fields, not with static textures.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external images or models.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE PAINTING, EXACTLY
- Open with the camera positioned so the scene reproduces The Starry Night's exact composition, edge to edge: the great flame-shaped cypress dark on the left, the sleeping village with its pointed steeple below, the rolling blue hills, the eleven radiant stars, the crescent moon burning orange in the upper right, and the vast double-spiral swirl commanding the center of the sky.
- Palette fidelity is non-negotiable: deep ultramarine and cobalt night, chrome yellow and ochre star halos, the pale turquoise ribbon of the sky rivers, blacks-greens of the cypress, warm lamplight in the village windows. Any drift toward generic navy-and-white space art is failure.
- The image must hold for a breath as a convincing painting - visible impasto ridges, stroke direction following Van Gogh's actual rhythms (horizontal weave in the sky rivers, licking verticals in the cypress, shingled dabs on the hills).
- The instant the viewer moves the mouse, parallax reveals the truth: strokes at different depths slide against each other. No menus, titles, overlays or instructions - the discovery IS the opening.

#### THE SKY AS LIVING PAINT - DYNAMISM IS THE SOUL
- Build the sky from hundreds of thousands of instanced brushstroke ribbons: curved, tapered, thick-edged strips with painted-color gradients and subtle emissive glow, oriented and advected along a great curl-noise flow field shaped to Van Gogh's actual swirl composition.
- The entire sky flows perpetually, at the pace of slow water: the double spiral turns over tens of seconds, sky rivers stream between the stars, strokes are continuously carried along the field and recycled invisibly so the composition never dissolves - the painting is the equilibrium the motion lives inside.
- Stars are the second motion system: each of the eleven stars and the moon is a blazing core wrapped in concentric orbiting halo strokes that pulse gently, shed drifting flecks of yellow paint, and visibly stir the flow field around them like heat above a fire.
- Nothing in the sky may ever be static. A paused frame should still look exactly like the painting; thirty seconds of watching should feel like standing inside slow luminous weather.

#### THE FLIGHT INWARD - THE PAINTING IS INFINITE
- The core mind-blow: the viewer can leave the hillside and fly INTO the sky. Scrolling or flying forward passes through the first stroke layers - ribbons of paint sliding past the camera close enough to read their bristle grooves - and reveals that the swirl continues inward: larger structures resolve out of the deep, new spirals behind the first, star systems of paint further back, rivers of turquoise flowing between them.
- Implement genuinely deep layering: procedurally generated swirl and star structures continuing for many nested depth shells, each shell consistent with the painting's palette and stroke language, streaming in ahead of the camera and released behind it so the flight can continue indefinitely in any direction into the sky.
- Depth must be felt: parallax between stroke layers, stars passing beside the camera like burning wheels, occasional colossal swirls the size of the whole original painting drifting past in the far deep, atmosphere hazing distant structures toward deep ultramarine.
- Flying is effortless and beautiful: smooth inertial flight toward the look direction, slow default drift if hands-off, one reset that returns to the exact painting composition from frame one - the return to flatness after deep flight is itself a wow.

#### THE VILLAGE AND EARTH BELOW - THE QUIET COUNTERWEIGHT
- The village is fully built, not a backdrop: tiled roofs as shingled stroke-dabs, the church steeple, glowing amber windows with individual warm flickers, lanes, hedgerows, the rolling hills in layered stroke-waves, distant blue mountains.
- The cypress is a hero object: a three-dimensional tower of writhing black-green flame strokes, its tips genuinely licking and swaying in slow motion, close enough to fly around and through.
- The earth breathes too: wind visibly travels across the wheat and hills as waves of stroke re-orientation, chimney smoke rises in curling painted threads, window lights flicker, the hills' strokes shimmer as cloud shadows from the sky pass over them.
- Looking BACK down at the village from deep inside the sky - the little glowing town far below beneath the churning painted cosmos - must be a composed, breathtaking view; tune the scale relationship deliberately for it.

#### MATERIAL TRUTH - IMPASTO OR NOTHING
- Strokes are paint, not light: thick ribbon geometry with ridge highlights along their edges, matte body color, subtle emissive only where Van Gogh used his brightest pigment (star cores, moon, windows). Specular glints crawl along impasto ridges as the camera moves.
- Close approach must survive: a single stroke filling the screen should read as a believable trowel of oil paint - directional bristle grooves, slight color marbling, torn edges.
- Background between strokes is never empty black: deep layered underpainting tones so every gap reads as painted canvas depth, not void.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate free flight plus orbit fallback; reset to the exact painting view. Presets: the painting composition; among the village rooftops looking up; circling the cypress crown; alongside the moon; deep-sky looking back at the village; inside the heart of the great spiral.
- Compact controls only: flow intensity (becalmed / Van Gogh / storm), flight speed, and photo mode. Nothing else - the painting does not need a UI.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Instanced stroke rendering throughout with aggressive frustum and depth-shell management; nearest strokes full ribbon geometry, mid-field simplified ribbons, deep field as oriented stroke sprites that are visually indistinguishable at their distance.
- Quality selector reduces stroke counts and shell depth before ever sacrificing palette fidelity, flow motion or first-frame accuracy.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most famous sky in art, finally deep enough to fly into.

<summary><strong>46. Monet's Water Lilies - The Drift</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience inside Monet's water-lily world at Giverny: a vast pond that is also a painting - its entire surface and gardens built from floating dabs of pure color - drifted through by boat while the light slides through the whole Water Lilies series, from silver morning mist to blazing sunset to blue evening. This must not be a realistic pond render, a flat animated canvas, a tight little garden corner, or a static scene with a nice skybox. It is immersion in color itself: Monet's late panoramas made into a place with real depth, where water, willows, sky and flowers are all congregations of living paint-dabs.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion dabs: every element - lily pads, blossoms, water surface, reflections, willow curtains, sky - assembled from individual touches of color in Monet's broken-color technique, shimmering perpetually. Achieve this with instanced dab geometry (small oriented lozenges of paint) over simple underlying forms, palette-driven per lighting state.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE PAINTING, EXACTLY
- Open composing one of the iconic late Water Lilies panoramas: no horizon, no bank - the frame filled entirely by pond surface seen at Monet's tilted angle, drifts of lily pads with pink and white blossoms crossing diagonally, the water carrying inverted willows and clouds in vertical streaks of violet, green and rose.
- Broken-color fidelity is non-negotiable: no smooth blends anywhere - every apparent color is adjacent dabs of different hues (the famous violet shadows built from blues and pinks side by side), edges soft and lost, blossoms as thick confident touches of white and rose with orange hearts.
- Hold for a breath as a convincing canvas. The first movement breaks it open: the dabs have DEPTH - reflection dabs lie on the water plane, pad dabs float above it, willow dabs hang meters overhead - and the pond recedes into real distance. No menus, titles or instructions.

#### THE POND AS A WORLD
- Scale generously: the pond is a broad dreamlike water-garden - far larger than the real Giverny - with archipelagos of lily rafts, channels of open reflective water between them, the Japanese footbridge (Monet's other icon) arching over a narrows draped in wisteria, curtains of willow trailing to the surface, banks of iris and agapanthus, and poplar crowns closing the distance in violet haze.
- The viewer drifts in a low flat-bottomed skiff - the default experience is the boat's gentle autonomous glide along a winding route through the archipelagos, under the willow curtains (dabs brushing past the camera like beaded strands), beneath the bridge and out into open water; free flight and free-boat steering are toggles.
- The water surface is the masterwork layer: a dense field of horizontal reflection dabs - inverted willows, sky color, cloud whites - that continuously slide, stretch and re-knit with the water's slow movement, parting around the bow in soft V-ripples that rearrange the reflected world; lily rafts rise and fall on the swell of the boat's wake.

#### LIGHT - THE SERIES AS A CYCLE
- The signature system: the entire world's palette continuously and slowly travels through Monet's series - silver-pink dawn mist (thin veils drifting between the rafts), clear morning blues and greens, saturated golden afternoon, the blazing orange-and-violet sunset water, and deep blue evening with the last blossoms glowing pale - a full cycle over roughly ten minutes, every transition itself beautiful.
- Palette changes are wholesale re-paintings: dabs individually re-color in soft traveling washes across the pond (not a global tint), so the viewer can watch sunset sweep across the water as a wave of re-touched paint - the series' whole point, made visible.
- Each state must match its canvases: mist state nearly monochrome silver-rose with dissolved forms; sunset state with the water burning in orange dabs against violet - screenshot-fidelity to the family of paintings at every phase.

#### DYNAMISM AS DOCTRINE
- Nothing is still: every dab carries a faint independent shimmer (tiny orientation and luminance flutter - the optical vibration broken color creates); reflections perpetually work; pads drift almost imperceptibly and rock on wakes; blossoms open slightly through morning phases and close toward evening; willow curtains sway; dragonflies stitch between blossoms; fish shadows slide beneath the dab-field and break the surface in soft rings; petals occasionally detach and ride the water.
- The mist state adds slow volumetric veils; the sunset state adds long light-columns of orange dabs stretching toward the camera across open water; evening brings the first stars as sparse high dabs in the water's reflection before they appear overhead - a designed poetic touch.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- The boat glides from the first second; steering (gentle rudder) or hands-off drifting both work; flight toggle for overviews - from above, the pond must read as one continuous Monet canvas the boat is drawing a line through; reset returns to the exact opening panorama.
- Presets: the opening canvas; bow-level among the blossoms; beneath the willow curtain; the Japanese bridge view (composed to match its own painting); open-water sunset blaze; the dawn-mist whiteout.
- Compact controls only: light-cycle position (scrubbable), drift speed, dab size (fine / bold - shifting between early and late Monet's touch), and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Instanced dabs with distance-collapsing LOD (near: full lozenge geometry with thickness; mid: flat oriented quads; far: point sprites) - density always reads as continuous paint; underlying simple meshes never visible.
- Quality selector reduces dab counts and mist sampling before ever sacrificing broken-color fidelity, the light cycle or reflection life.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most beloved color in art, deep enough to row through.

<summary><strong>47. The Great Wave at True Scale</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience inside Hokusai's Great Wave off Kanagawa at true physical scale: the viewer stands at oarsman height on one of the boats while a forty-foot wall of woodblock ocean hangs overhead, falling at one-hundredth speed - always falling, never landing - with Mount Fuji small and serene through the gap beneath the crest. This must not be a flat picture with parallax layers, a tabletop diorama, a realistic water simulation that abandons the woodblock style, or a dark stormy scene. It is the most famous image in Japanese art experienced from inside, at the size it depicts, in its exact visual language.

The goal is scale terror rendered in ukiyo-e: the wave as a genuine three-dimensional mountain of stylized water whose every surface obeys Hokusai's print language - flat Prussian-blue color bands, pale linework, clawed foam - while behaving as a real volume the camera can move around, under and above. Achieve the style with cel/toon shading, posterized color ramps and outline rendering; achieve the foam claws with instanced claw geometry along the crest, not particle mush.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE PRINT, EXACTLY
- Open with the camera positioned so the scene reproduces the print's exact composition edge to edge: the great wave rearing on the left with its overhanging claw of foam, the deep trough, two low oar-boats with rowers flat against them, the smaller foreground wave echoing Fuji's shape, and Fuji itself centered small in the distance with its snow cap.
- Style fidelity is non-negotiable: the print's exact restricted palette (deep Prussian blue, paler blues, warm cream sky bands, the boats' pale wood and dark hulls), flat posterized shading with crisp banding, fine dark contour lines on every form, and the subtle off-white of aged paper in the lightest tones. Any drift toward glossy realistic water is failure.
- Hold for a breath as a convincing print. The first mouse movement breaks the flatness: the wave has volume, the boats sit at different depths, the trough is a real valley of water. No menus, titles or instructions.

#### THE WAVE AT TRUE SCALE - THE MIND-BLOW
- The default position after the opening is ON THE BOAT: camera at a crouching oarsman's eye height, the deck pitching gently beneath, rowers ahead and behind, and the wave filling the entire upper field of view - a cliff of blue water with its crest overhanging the boat, foam claws the size of trees reaching down.
- Time inside the scene runs at roughly one-hundredth speed: the wave IS falling - the crest advances with glacial menace, claws extend finger by finger, spray droplets drift like snow - but it never completes. The terror is permanent and the viewer has unlimited time to study it.
- The wave must read as a volume from every angle: walk the camera around it, under the overhang (the print's own viewpoint made literal - looking up through the claw at the sky), above the crest looking down into the trough at the boats, and from Fuji's direction back through the gap.
- Secondary water is fully built: the foreground wave echoing Fuji's silhouette (stage this alignment deliberately - it is the print's famous visual rhyme), the churning trough, interlocking swell patterns to the horizon, all in banded ukiyo-e blues with linework.

#### THE STYLE AS RENDERING LAW
- Cel/toon shading everywhere: stepped color ramps, zero smooth gradients, colors quantized to the print's palette; a full-screen outline pass draws crisp dark contours on silhouettes and interior form edges, weighted like brush linework.
- Foam is drawn, not simulated: the crest carries hundreds of instanced claw shapes - curved, tapering, fingered forms straight from the print - that grow, reach and fragment in ultra-slow motion, shedding drifting dot-spray (instanced discs, not fog).
- Woodblock truth in close-up: subtle paper-grain texture in flat areas, faint registration warmth at color edges, linework that thickens and thins. A screenshot from any angle should pass as a lost Hokusai plate.
- The sky carries the print's quiet horizontal bands; light is soft and directionless like a print, with form read through banding, never through realistic specular.

#### DYNAMISM - SLOW, TOTAL, PERPETUAL
- Everything moves at the scene's dilated pace, and nothing is static: the wave's advance, claw growth, drifting spray, the boats pitching and shipping water in slow surges, rowers straining in long slow strokes with cloth rippling, the foreground wave rising, gulls hanging nearly motionless over the trough, cloud bands sliding imperceptibly past Fuji.
- The boats are alive: three slender oar-boats with correct low profiles, rows of oarsmen flattened against the hulls in the print's exact poses, oars trailing slow wakes, water sheeting off gunwales in stylized banded runnels.
- A very slow global cycle (minutes long) lets the wave advance meaningfully - the crest creeping visibly closer to the lead boat - before seamlessly recycling to the print's exact composition, so long viewing rewards attention and the reset is invisible.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate free flight with smooth inertia plus orbit fallback; reset returns to the exact print composition. Presets: the print view; the oarsman's seat under the crest; inside the claw looking up; above the crest looking down at the boats; the Fuji-aligned trough view; the foreground wave and Fuji silhouette rhyme.
- Compact controls only: time dilation (frozen / one-hundredth / one-tenth), spray density, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- The wave as sculpted mesh with shader-banded coloring (cheap), claws and spray instanced with LOD, boats and figures modest geometry carried by linework, distant swells as shader displacement.
- Quality selector reduces spray and claw counts and outline sampling before ever sacrificing palette accuracy, the outline pass or the first-frame match.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the wave that has been about to fall for two hundred years, finally hanging over your own head.

<summary><strong>48. Bruegel's Tower of Babel, Living</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js environment of Bruegel's Tower of Babel as a complete living world: the colossal spiral tower exactly as he painted it - part masterpiece, part mountain, part ruin-in-progress - rising from a bustling sixteenth-century Flemish port, its ramps crawling with thousands of tiny builders, cranes turning, ships unloading stone at the quays, and the summit disappearing into passing cloud. This must not be a smooth CGI ziggurat, a sparse model on flat ground, a fantasy tower, or a static architectural study. It is the painting's staggering density made explorable: a billion-piece civilization organized around one impossible building.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion individually considered pieces: every arch of the tower's hundreds, scaffolds, ramps, hoists, brick kilns, dressed stone blocks, ships' rigging, wagons, and a population of thousands at work. Achieve this with heavy instancing over a carefully sculpted hero structure, and nested LOD - the tower must reward both the ten-kilometer view and the ten-meter view.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE PAINTING, EXACTLY
- Open composing Bruegel's Vienna version: the tower filling the frame from its rock-cored base to its cloud-wrapped unfinished crown, seen from the painting's elevated angle - its spiral of arcaded levels leaning perceptibly (Bruegel built the lean in; keep it), the red raw-brick upper works contrasting the pale weathered stone below, the port and city small at its feet, the sea with sails at the right, green Flemish country rolling away left.
- Fidelity to the painting's character is non-negotiable: the tower is simultaneously rising and decaying - completed levels already weathering, exposed interior vaults where cladding is unbuilt, scaffolding patches, the geological rock outcrop it engulfs at its base. It must feel colossal, organic and slightly doomed, never clean.
- The frame is already teeming at painting distance: crane silhouettes turning on the ramps, smoke threads from kilns, ships moving in the roads, cloud shadow crossing the plain. No menus, titles or instructions.

#### THE TOWER - ARCHITECTURE AS LANDSCAPE
- Build the full spiral logic: a helical ramp climbing the tower's exterior through dozens of arcaded levels, each level a city street's worth of arches, buttresses, stair towers, work yards, material dumps and shelter huts; interior glimpses through unfinished sections reveal nested vaults and ramps within.
- Construction is staged vertically exactly as Bruegel has it: lower levels inhabited and weathered (laundry between arches, market stalls in the arcades, grass on old ledges), middle levels active construction (scaffolds, cranes, fresh stone), top levels raw brick skeleton in cloud, with the great treadwheel cranes - Bruegel's famous machines - perched at the working edges, their wheels visibly walked by tiny figures as they hoist blocks.
- The summit pierces a slowly streaming cloud layer: mist tearing around the unfinished crown, the top appearing and vanishing - the painting's theological weather made real and perpetual.
- Close approach anywhere must reward: individual bricks and stone courses, mortar lines, timber scaffold lashings, rope hoists, chisel-dressed block faces, stains where rain runs off the arches.

#### THE WORLD AT ITS FEET
- The port city from the painting, fully alive: quays where stone ships unload with swinging derricks, warehouses, a crowded roofscape of Flemish gables, town squares, the harbor crowded with carracks and barges under sail arriving and departing with wakes, the rocky shore, and cultivated country with hedgerows, wagon roads and windmills rolling to the horizon.
- Supply is the story: a continuous visible logistics river feeding the tower - barges to quay, quay cranes to wagons, wagon trains up the spiral ramp, ramp cranes to the working levels - one unbroken chain of thousands of instanced workers, animals and machines that the viewer can follow end to end from a ship's hold to a block being set at the summit.
- Nothing floats or stops abruptly: shore, city, fields and sea form a complete panorama fading into Bruegel's blue-green atmospheric distance.

#### THE THOUSANDS - LABOR AS SPECTACLE
- Populate at painting density: masons dressing stone in the yards, hod carriers on the ramps, treadwheel walkers, foremen pointing, mortar mixers, rope teams, ox wagons, dockworkers, sailors aloft, women carrying food baskets up the spiral, dogs, gulls, and - at the base, as in the painting - the king's inspection party with kneeling stonemasons, staged as a readable vignette.
- All figures are instanced, small and purposeful - recognizable by posture and motion, never by face - with dozens of distinct work-loop behaviors distributed across the structure so every level the viewer visits is doing something different.
- The tower AUDIBLY works in visual terms: cranes turning at a dozen heights simultaneously, blocks rising on ropes, scaffold planks bouncing under carriers, kiln smoke drifting, dust puffs where stone is set.

#### DYNAMISM AND LIGHT
- Perpetual motion at every scale: the cloud river at the summit, cloud shadows sweeping the plain and climbing the tower's flank, ships working the roads, the logistics chain flowing, cranes and treadwheels turning, laundry and banners stirring, gull flocks spiraling the upper levels.
- Late-afternoon Flemish light as default: warm sun raking the spiral so each level throws its arcade shadows, the red brick crown glowing against slate-blue cloud, the sea glittering - Bruegel's palette, brightened for wonder rather than doom.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Orbit, pan and zoom immediately, tuned for the full range - ten kilometers to ten meters; reset returns to the painting's exact composition. A slow default aerial drift circles the tower if untouched.
- Presets: the painting view; the quayside beneath the tower's overhang looking up the full spiral; a working level among the cranes; the treadwheel close-up; the summit in the cloud river; the king's vignette; the long country view with the tower on the horizon like a second mountain.
- Compact controls only: time of light (afternoon / golden evening / silver morning), activity density, cloud level height, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- The tower as sculpted hero geometry with instanced arch/scaffold/crane modules and per-instance weathering variation; figures, ships, wagons and gulls as instanced agent pools with LOD to animated silhouettes; city and country as merged geometry with instanced detail near the camera.
- Quality selector reduces population, gulls and far detail before ever sacrificing the tower's silhouette, its close-range stonework or the cloud interaction.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most ambitious building never finished, finally at full height around you.

<summary><strong>49. Inside the Action - A Pollock in Time</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience inside a Jackson Pollock drip painting - and inside the act that made it. A Pollock is a frozen recording of motion: every filament is the trace of one whip of the painter's arm. This experience gives the painting its depth back AND its time back. It opens as the flat, instantly recognizable painting; movement reveals the tangle is genuinely three-dimensional - glossy enamel filaments hanging in deep space - and the centerpiece is watching the painting perform itself: lines lashing through the void around the viewer, layer over layer, until the full painting hangs in space again. This must not be a random particle mess, a static spaghetti sculpture, an abstract music-visualizer, or a gray tech demo. It is action painting made explorable.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion feet of flung paint: filaments from rope-thick to hair-fine, droplets frozen mid-splash, arcs and whips crossing tens of meters, all with the material truth of gloss enamel. Achieve this with instanced tube and droplet geometry along simulated whip trajectories, not with noise soup.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE PAINTING, FLAT AND TRUE
- Open dead-on to a full-frame composition in the authentic language of Pollock's 1950 masterworks (Autumn Rhythm / One: Number 31): a dense allover web with NO focal center, layered in the correct order and palette - raw warm canvas, then diluted tan and teal pours, then whites, then the assertive black lines whipped over everything, with silver-gray accents.
- Composition rules matter for recognizability: allover density to every edge, rhythmic looping arcs (not jitter), long confident lashes crossing the whole canvas, pooled thick spots where lines slowed, fine spray where they moved fast. Random scribble is failure; the web must have the athletic rhythm of a painter's arm.
- Hold as a convincing flat painting for a breath. Then the first mouse movement separates the layers: parallax reveals every filament lives at its own depth in a space many meters deep. The flatness was an illusion of viewpoint. No menus, titles or instructions.

#### THE TANGLE AS A PLACE
- Once inside, the painting is a navigable environment: filaments as real three-dimensional glossy tubes - thick ropes of black enamel, ribbons of white where paint fell edge-on, hair-fine threads of silver, strings of teardrop droplets frozen mid-flight with motion-stretched shapes, and pooled blobs where pours collided.
- Scale is the awe: the web extends dozens of meters in every direction, with tunnels and caverns through the density; the viewer flies through gaps, ducks under a black arc thick as an arm, follows one single line through the entire tangle to its final flick.
- Enamel material truth: high-gloss specular running along every filament like light down wet cable, subtle sag between anchor moments, drips descending from the undersides of thick lines, color marbling where two wet colors crossed and bled.
- The space between filaments glows warm raw-canvas, hazing with depth so the deep tangle recedes in cream fog - the painting's own colorspace, never a black void.

#### THE PERFORMANCE - TIME IS THE MASTERPIECE
- The signature spectacle: a large, elegant timeline scrubber runs the painting's creation. Pulled to zero, the space empties to blank canvas glow. Pressed play, the painting performs itself around the viewer in real time over about two minutes.
- Each line is born as a live lash: a luminous leading point whips through space on an athletic trajectory - accelerating sweeps, tight loops, sudden reversals, the pause-and-drip of a held stance - extruding its glossy filament behind it, shedding droplets on the fast passages that fly outward and freeze into the constellation. Multiple lashes overlap as layers advance: tans first, then whites, then the black assault, then silver grace notes.
- The choreography must feel ARM-driven: trajectories generated from simulated shoulder-elbow-wrist motion with momentum and rhythm, working the whole canvas the way Pollock walked around it - not random splines. The viewer should feel the dance.
- Scrubbing is fully bidirectional and buttery: drag backward and lashes retract, droplets fly home, layers unpeel; freeze mid-whip and orbit a single lash caught crossing thirty meters of air with its droplet spray hanging around it - the best photograph in the whole experience.
- While paused at any point, everything remains subtly alive: specular glints crawling as the camera moves, the freshest filaments still glistening wetter than the old, one slow drip occasionally falling from a heavy line.

#### DYNAMISM EVERYWHERE, EVEN AT REST
- At full completion (default state after the opening), the tangle is never frozen dead: near-imperceptible tension sway in the longest spans, occasional droplet-fall from thick pools, light breathing slowly across the web like studio daylight moving, dust motes in the canvas-glow air.
- Flying itself must be dynamic: filaments whipping past the camera in close flight create natural speed drama; brushing very close to a line makes its droplet string tremble.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate smooth inertial flight plus orbit fallback; reset returns to the flat painting viewpoint - watching the deep tangle collapse back into a flat famous image as the camera returns is a designed wow, align it perfectly.
- Presets: the flat painting; inside the central cavern; following the longest black line; the droplet constellation close-up; the wide view showing the whole web hanging in space like a captured explosion.
- Compact controls only: the creation timeline (the hero), flight speed, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Filaments as instanced tube segments with LOD (full tubes near, camera-facing ribbon impostors deep); droplets instanced; trajectory data precomputed at load so playback and scrubbing are pure animation, never physics stalls.
- Quality selector reduces deep-field filament count and droplet density before ever sacrificing playback smoothness, scrub fidelity or gloss material quality.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the act of action painting, standing inside it.

## Impossible Vantages

<a id="prompt-50"></a>

<summary><strong>50. The Garden at One Millimeter - Rainstorm</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of a rainstorm in a garden at one millimeter tall: the viewer stands ant-high on a leaf as raindrops the size of exercise balls fall out of a canyon of towering grass blades, detonating on impact into slow crystal crowns, rolling across leaves as trembling glass boulders, and swelling dew into lens-worlds that refract the whole garden upside down - while a bumblebee thunders overhead like a furred airship and an ant convoy shelters under a fallen petal. Everyone knows this garden; no one has stood in it at this size during rain. This must not be a giant-props cartoon, a serene macro wallpaper, a murky puddle scene, or a physics tech demo on a gray plane. It is the most familiar place on Earth turned into an epic landscape under glorious bombardment - macro-photography beauty with action-movie pacing.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion-piece micro-world: leaf surfaces as landscapes of cells and ridges, water as the hero material in every form (falling sphere, impact crown, crawling rivulet, trembling dome, merging pool), light behaving like macro photography - shallow warm sun shafts, bokeh-soft distances, everything backlit and glowing. Achieve the water with instanced drop systems, impact-triggered crown meshes and soft-body dome shading; never particle mist.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE STORM ARRIVES
- Open on the leaf plateau at one-millimeter eye height, mid-storm: a vast green terrain of vein ridges and glistening cell texture stretching away to the leaf's curled edge, the grass-blade towers rising all around into a bright silver sky - and the rain already falling: enormous glassy spheres dropping past in the middle distance, one detonating on the plateau a body-length away in a slow-blooming crown of crystal, droplets the size of heads scattering and rolling.
- Time runs at macro-camera speed: roughly one-tenth real speed, so every drop's fall is trackable, every crown blooms readably, every splash droplet arcs with visible grace - constant spectacular motion the eye can actually feast on. This dilation is the experience's core rendering of scale: small worlds genuinely experience time this way.
- The light is rain-light at its best: bright pearl sky, backlit drops burning like falling lamps, the garden glowing saturated green, warm sun breaking through in shafts that turn falling rain into strings of fire. Never gloomy - a storm in a bright world.
- No menus, titles or reveals; the bombardment is in progress.

#### WATER AS THE HERO MATERIAL
- Every state of water is a set-piece: falling drops as wobbling refractive spheres carrying inverted garden images inside them; impacts as sculpted crown splashes that rise, crenellate and collapse in dilated grace; landed water as trembling dome-boulders that creep, merge hungrily into bigger domes, and suddenly release downslope in rivulet floods when they breach a vein ridge; the leaf-edge waterfall where gathered water sheets off into the canyon below; dew beads strung on a spider line overhead like a necklace of lenses, each refracting the entire scene upside down.
- Water BEHAVES at this scale: surface tension is visible law - domes quiver but hold, small droplets ride convex leaf hairs without falling, a rolling drop consumes smaller beads as it passes and grows. The moment a boulder-drop rolls toward the camera and swallows a dew bead in passing is the material thesis in one shot.
- The viewer's leaf must flex with the strikes: each nearby impact bows the whole plateau in a slow springy wave that rolls underfoot, water sloshing in response - the ground itself is alive.

#### THE GARDEN AS EPIC TERRAIN
- Build a true macro landscape, deep and layered: the leaf plateau and its canyon of grass towers; a flower stem rising like a furred monument to a poppy canopy far above that glows red like a stained-glass ceiling when sun breaks through; a fallen petal arched like a silk pavilion (the ant convoy shelters beneath it, antennae flicking at each impact thud); soil below as a boulder field of glistening grains; a pebble like a cliff face streaked with rain; a puddle spreading across the soil like an advancing sea, its surface hammered into overlapping ring systems by the strikes.
- Macro wildlife carries the middle action, all magnificent at this scale: the bumblebee crossing overhead on its patrol - furred, backlit, wings a shimmering blur, its downdraft flattening nearby water domes; a snail traversing a leaf edge like a slow glass-and-marble barge, rain beading on its shell; a ladybird trundling to shelter, wing-cases jeweled with droplets; a springtail catapulting away from an impact in a comic bounce; the spider tending its bead-strung line.
- Everything is instanced, individually varied and purposeful; the creatures shelter, emerge and travel with the storm's rhythm.

#### THE STORM'S ARC - DYNAMISM WITH NARRATIVE
- The weather runs a continuous grand cycle over several minutes: steady bombardment; a crescendo cloudburst (strikes doubling, rivulets everywhere, the leaf waterfall roaring); the break - rain thinning, the sun shafting through in full force, every surface exploding into sparkle and rising mist-wisps, a rainbow arcing between grass towers; then the drips - the long gorgeous afterstorm of gathered water releasing bead by bead from every tip - and the sky closes for the next round.
- The break-and-sparkle phase is the emotional payoff; stage its arrival with a traveling sunline that sweeps across the terrain igniting water as it goes.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate first-person walking across the flexing leaf terrain plus free flight through the full canyon system - flying up through falling drops to the poppy canopy is a designed thrill run; reset returns to the plateau vantage.
- Presets: the plateau under bombardment; nose-to-drop with a falling sphere's refracted world; the crown-splash close orbit; the dew-necklace lens view; under the petal pavilion with the ants; the puddle-sea ring patterns from above; the sun-break sparkle moment.
- Compact controls only: storm phase (scrubbable through the cycle), time dilation (macro / normal), creature activity, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Drops, splash droplets and dew instanced with pooled lifetimes; crown splashes as triggered morphing meshes; domes as soft-shaded blobs with tension shaders; terrain flex via vertex waves; creatures as low-bone instanced rigs; depth-of-field bokeh as the standing post effect (it sells macro scale more than any geometry - keep it tasteful and focused on the middle distance).
- Quality selector reduces drop counts, splash complexity and bokeh sampling before ever sacrificing time dilation, surface-tension behavior or the storm cycle.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the garden outside every window, revealed as the most spectacular place its smallest citizens have always known.

<summary><strong>51. The Hoard - A Mountain of Gold and One Open Eye</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience inside the dragon's hoard: a cavern the size of a stadium filled with a genuine mountain range of gold - hundreds of millions of coins in dunes and avalanching slopes, studded with crowns, goblets, gem-fire and half-buried armor - and somewhere beneath the treasure, the dragon itself: a ridge of dark scales rising from the gold, one wing like a folded cathedral roof, smoke curling from nostrils the size of doorways, asleep. Every step the viewer takes sends coins sliding; take too much interest in the wrong pile and an eye the size of a shield slides open. This must not be a small pile of yellow discs, a flat golden floor, a cartoon vault, or a fight scene. It is the Smaug image every reader carries - material opulence at absurd scale, plus the sleeping-volcano tension of the creature under it.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion pieces of treasure: coins as INDIVIDUAL instanced objects in the near and middle field - lying, stacked, sliding, glinting - dissolving seamlessly into shader-built dunes at distance; and gold as the hero material, lit by shafts of cold daylight from the mountain ceiling against the warm ember-glow of the dragon's breath. Achieve the avalanches with localized granular simulation around disturbances, not global physics.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - THE GOLDEN RANGE
- Open at floor level on a treasure slope: dunes of coins rising and falling away in every direction like a desert cast in gold, shafts of pale daylight dropping from cracks in the cavern ceiling and detonating in glitter where they strike the slopes, gem clusters burning red and green in the shadows - and dominating the middle distance, the dark scaled ridge of the sleeping dragon half-submerged in treasure, one horn and the folded wing silhouetted, twin threads of smoke rising from beyond the nearest dune.
- The gold must be overwhelming and REAL: coins at every angle catching light differently, worn relief on faces, stacks leaning, spills frozen mid-slide, tarnished bronze veins through the brighter gold, silver drifts, the occasional pearl scatter like pale bubbles. Angle-dependent glitter across every slope as the camera moves is the signature material effect - make the whole landscape sparkle in motion.
- Warm-cold light theater: cold white ceiling shafts versus the deep warm ember light that pulses faintly from the dragon's direction with each of its breaths, meeting across the dunes. Bright enough to celebrate the gold everywhere; grand shadow, never murk.
- No menus, titles or reveals; the hoard and its owner are simply there.

#### TREASURE AS TERRAIN - AND IT MOVES
- Walking IS the mechanic: every footstep sinks slightly and sends coins skittering downslope in small believable cascades; walking across a steep dune face triggers longer slides that go glittering down into the dark; standing still lets the last coins settle tick by tick around your feet. This granular response - local, physical, endlessly satisfying - is the experience's tactile heart; simulate a generous bubble of real coin bodies around the camera and any disturbance, blending outward into animated shader-flow.
- Stage set-piece instabilities: a leaning tower of stacked platters that collapses magnificently if approached too directly; a knight's armored skeleton that comes loose from a slope and slides down in pieces; a great shield that can be dislodged to toboggan down a dune face throwing a bow-wave of coins.
- Treasure landmarks reward pilgrimage across the cavern: a throne of a drowned king buried to its armrests; a war-chest burst open in a frozen explosion of pearls; a chandelier fallen like a golden ribcage; a gem the size of a boulder - the Arkenstone note - glowing faintly inside a coin drift, lighting it from within.

#### THE DRAGON - THE VOLCANO YOU WOKE
- The dragon is built for magnificence at distance and terror up close: a mountain-ridge of overlapping scales each the size of a door with iridescent oil-sheen edges, the folded wing's membrane translucent where a ceiling shaft crosses it, talons like obsidian plows emerging from the gold, the great head resting on a treasure dune with nostrils venting slow smoke - and the whole form BREATHING, a six-second swell that makes coins trickle continuously off its flanks in silver threads.
- The tension system is the masterpiece: the dragon reacts to the viewer's cumulative disturbance. Small avalanches - a distant scale-ripple, a smoke puff. Bigger ones - the wing shifts with a vast leathery rustle and a coin-slide roars off it; a low ember-light pulse rolls through the cavern. Push far enough and THE EYE OPENS: the nearest eyelid slides back on a molten-gold slit pupil that fixes on the camera, tracks it with terrible patience while the ember glow builds... then, if the viewer stays still, closes again with glacial slowness. It never attacks; the entire drama lives in almost.
- A subtle disturbance meter is unnecessary - the dragon IS the meter, and reading its state from scale-ripples, smoke rate and ember pulses is the game.

#### DYNAMISM EVERYWHERE
- The hoard never sleeps even when the dragon does: coin trickles running off the breathing flanks, settling ticks across the dunes, glitter crawling with every camera move, dust motes in the ceiling shafts, smoke threads curling, gem-fire winking, distant unexplained slides in dark corners (the hoard settling under its own weight - or something moving), bats spiraling the ceiling cracks.
- The ember-glow breath cycle warms and cools the whole cavern's light perpetually - the scene's slow visual heartbeat.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate first-person walking with the granular response live from step one, plus free flight (flying is calm - the dragon only counts what touches its gold); reset returns to the opening slope.
- Presets: the golden range hero view; nose-close to a coin drift with the glitter horizon behind; the throne; the Arkenstone drift; alongside the breathing flank; the eye at the moment it opens (staged safely at preset distance); the ceiling-shaft aerial of the entire hoard with the dragon-shape readable in the gold.
- Compact controls only: daylight shaft intensity, dragon temperament (deep sleep / light sleep - scales reaction thresholds), coin physics bubble size, and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Near-field coins as instanced rigid bodies in a camera-following simulation bubble; mid-field as instanced static meshes with slide-flow shaders on disturbance; far dunes as displaced golden terrain with glitter normal maps - the three tiers must blend invisibly.
- Quality selector shrinks the physics bubble and far glitter sampling before ever sacrificing footstep response, the dragon's breath-and-eye choreography or the gold material.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the richest room in fantasy, and you cannot stop touching the money.

<summary><strong>52. The Parting - Between the Walls of the Sea</strong></summary>

```text
Create a maximum-ambition Three.js experience of standing on the seabed between the parted walls of the Red Sea: two quivering cliffs of living ocean held impossibly apart, fish and rays suspended inside the translucent walls like creatures in glass, shafts of sunlight breaking through the churning crests fifty meters overhead, and a great crowd crossing the wet seabed corridor between them. One of the most cinematic images in all of human storytelling - and no one has ever stood inside it properly. This must not be a low corridor between two blue planes, a dark tunnel, a physics-accurate flood waiting to happen, or an empty walkway. It is the miracle held mid-moment, at full scale, alive on every surface.

The goal is the visual impression of a billion tons of suspended ocean: the walls as genuine volumetric water - lit depth, internal life, ceaseless churn - and the corridor as a real place with wet sand, stranded shells, puddles and a crossing multitude. Achieve the walls with layered translucent surfaces, internal depth fog, refracted light shafts and instanced marine life, not with flat scrolling textures.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external assets.

#### FIRST FRAME - INSIDE THE MIRACLE
- Open at human eye level in the middle of the corridor: the two ocean walls towering on either side close enough to feel, curving away toward a bright far shore, the crowd moving past and ahead, the seabed glistening, and overhead a ribbon of golden sky between the crests.
- The walls must overwhelm immediately: fifty-plus meters tall, visibly ALIVE - deep blue-green volumes with sunlight bleeding through their upper thirds, internal currents rolling, foam boiling along their tops, and their faces rippling in slow vertical waves as if straining against the hold.
- Light is the drama: low golden-hour sun slicing through the western wall in massive refracted shafts that sweep slowly across the corridor, puddles blazing, spray mist drifting through the beams. Bright, warm and awesome - never a gloomy trench.
- No menus, titles or reveals; the crossing is already mid-flow.

#### THE WALLS - OCEAN AS ARCHITECTURE
- Build each wall as a layered volume: an outer face of rippling refractive surface; internal depth with fog-graded blue and drifting particulate; schools of instanced fish turning inside like living confetti; larger silhouettes - rays gliding, a shark patrolling, a whale passing deep and vast on a long cycle (its slow transit behind the wall is a designed showstopper); seagrass and disturbed sediment near the base.
- The wall faces weep and shed: constant thin runnels and droplets, small bulges that swell and settle, occasional brief spouts that arc into the corridor and slap the sand - the hold is mighty but visibly effortful, and that tension is the scene's heartbeat.
- The tops churn: foam crests boiling against the sky ribbon, spray blowing across the gap, backlit droplets raining sparsely into the corridor.
- Never let the walls become static glass: every square meter carries motion - internal current, life, surface ripple - at all times.

#### THE CROSSING - HUMANITY IN THE GAP
- Populate the corridor with a generous instanced multitude crossing toward the far shore: families with bundles and staffs, children darting to touch the wall and being pulled back, elders helped over slick rocks, carts, herded goats and donkeys, all individually varied and purposeful, streaming past the camera in both directions of the frame's depth.
- Stage readable vignettes: a child's hand hovering an inch from the water face with fish gathering curiously on the other side (make the fish REACT to people near the wall - gathering, flashing, scattering); a fallen bundle retrieved; a lifted lantern against the wall's glow as the sun drops; a dog barking at a spout.
- The seabed is a discovered world: ribbed wet sand, tide pools with trapped darting fish, shells, coral heads, an ancient encrusted anchor and a hull rib half-buried - the ocean floor's secrets exposed to air for the first hour in history.

#### DYNAMISM AND THE HELD BREATH
- The scene runs a slow tension cycle over minutes: the walls' ripple amplitude and weep-rate swell gently (the hold straining) then ease, light shafts sweep, the crowd's pace quickens subtly at the swells - the miracle is stable but the world never lets you fully relax, which is exactly the feeling the image demands.
- Ambient life everywhere: gulls threading the sky ribbon, spray mist, wind-shivered puddles, wall-filtered light dancing in caustic patterns across sand and people - build real moving caustics from the wall faces; they are the scene's signature ground-layer effect.

#### EXPLORATION AND CONTROLS
- Immediate first-person walking along the full corridor plus free flight - rising up the wall face, through the spray crests and above into the open sunset sea is a designed breathtaker; reset returns to the opening eye-level view.
- Presets: the corridor hero view; palm-to-the-wall close-up with gathering fish; beneath a light shaft looking up; the whale transit view; above the crests at sunset; the far-shore look-back down the whole corridor.
- Compact controls only: sun height within the golden hour, crowd density, wall tension (calm hold / straining hold), and photo mode.

#### PERFORMANCE
- Wall internals as layered shader volumes with instanced fish (LOD to flecks at depth); crowd as instanced agent pools; caustics as animated projected shader, not raytracing; seabed detail instanced near the path.
- Quality selector reduces fish counts, crowd density and caustic resolution before ever sacrificing wall volumetric depth, refracted shafts or surface motion.
- Smooth on a modern laptop, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2. The outcome: the most famous impossible walk ever told, finally walkable.

<summary><strong>53. Niagara — The Complete Living Falls</strong></summary>

```text
Create a thunderous, complete Three.js Niagara: Horseshoe Falls and American Falls together, the gorge, the rapids above, the mist plume climbing into the sky, and the little blue boat pushing into the spray. Open directly on the full panorama with the falls already roaring, rainbows already standing in the mist. No title screen, menu, loading state, or quiet preamble.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the sheer mass of falling water as a living monument — and a boat ride into its throat.

#### THE WATER
- The falls are the masterpiece: green glassy water accelerating over the brink, tearing into white curtains, layered sheets with depth and backlight, churn pools boiling at the base, and the great mist column drifting with the wind.
- The river system must read upstream and down: racing rapids above the brink with standing waves, the emerald pool below, gulls riding the updrafts, logs occasionally sweeping over the edge.
- Rainbows are coupled to geometry: arcs standing in the mist where sun and spray meet, moving as the camera moves.

#### THE HUMAN SHORE
- Both banks alive but unobtrusive: observation decks and railings with small crowds, the tower, treelined paths, period-flavored buildings kept generic, tiny ponchos clustering at the rail points.
- The Maid-style boat works the pool continuously: pushing toward the horseshoe, holding in the spray, swinging away, passengers as flecks of blue.

#### LIGHT AND SEASONS
- Default bright summer afternoon with brilliant whites and deep greens. One simple variant control: a season-and-light selector (summer noon, golden evening, winter ice-rim with frozen mist trees) that transforms palette and edge detail without changing composition.

#### THE RIDE AND THE VIEWS
- One simple interaction: Ride the Boat — the camera mounts the bow on a fixed looping rail into the spray and back, no controls needed, spray wash intensifying near the curtain. Exit returns to free orbit.
- Orbit, pan, zoom always available; reset to the hero panorama. Presets: brink-edge looking over, pool-level facing the horseshoe, American Falls portrait, and a high aerial of the whole gorge.
- Tiny HUD: none beyond compact collapsible controls.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Water via layered shader surfaces and budgeted particles for spray, instanced crowds and trees, LOD across the gorge, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning spray and far detail before the falls themselves. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>54. Calving Day — Perito Moreno</strong></summary>

```text
Create a monumental Three.js scene of the Perito Moreno glacier front: a sixty-meter wall of fractured blue ice stretching across a milky turquoise lake, boardwalk crowds waiting on the peninsula, tour boats holding respectful distance — and on command, a tower of ice peels away and collapses in slow majesty. Open directly on the full face glittering in sun, small falls of ice dust already trickling, anticipation built in. No title screen, menu, loading state, or empty lake.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: the patience and violence of ice — a living wall that breaks on your command and makes the whole lake answer.

#### THE WALL
- Build the face with real glacial character: vertical fracture columns and seracs, deep crevasse shadows glowing impossible blue, white sun-bitten crests, meltwater streaks, arch hollows at the waterline. The wall must reward close inspection like architecture.
- Behind it, the glacier back stretches up-valley as a rumpled white river between dark Patagonian peaks.

#### THE CALVING
- One simple trigger: Calve — a chosen tower groans, sheds dust, leans and peels off in convincing large rigid fragments, plunging with a white eruption, then bobbing up as fresh blue bergs.
- The lake answers: a radial wave rolls out, rocks the tour boats visibly, slaps the shoreline; gulls burst off the water; brash ice spreads and drifts in the current.
- A replay scrub for the last collapse lets the viewer relive it in slow motion; each trigger varies the tower and break pattern.

#### THE PATAGONIAN STAGE
- Complete the place: layered boardwalks with small crowds that visibly react, southern beech forest in autumn rust and green, distant snow peaks, condors circling, lake water in glacial milk-turquoise with floating bergs of varied age.
- Crisp high-latitude sunlight, brilliant whites and blues, dramatic but never gloomy.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero head-on panorama of the wall. Presets: boardwalk crowd view, boat-deck view rocking on the wave, waterline view along the face, and a high aerial of glacier and lake.
- Controls: the calve trigger, replay scrub, and a sunlight-angle slider. Nothing else. Tiny HUD: height of the wall marker for scale. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Pre-fractured fragment pools for the collapse, instanced bergs and trees and crowds, budgeted spray, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning far valley before the wall face. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>55. Million Wings — The Monarch Forest at Sunrise</strong></summary>

```text
Create a breathtaking Three.js scene of the monarch butterfly overwintering forest in the Mexican highlands at the moment the sun arrives: oyamel fir boughs sagging under solid clusters of a million butterflies, the first warm rays moving across the trunks, and the earliest wings beginning to open. Open directly inside the grove with the clusters already vast and the light already climbing. Do not create a title screen, menu, loading state, or an empty forest.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Generate trees, butterflies, light and air entirely procedurally; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: a forest wearing a million butterflies — and one button that wakes them.

#### THE SLEEPING FOREST
- Build the clusters as dense instanced masses that read at three scales: from afar, branches that look like hanging amber foliage; closer, shingled layers of folded wings; near, individual monarchs with stained-glass wing patterns slowly fanning.
- Boughs must visibly bend under the weight; occasional small cascades of butterflies shift and resettle, releasing a few drifting individuals even before the main event.
- The grove itself is tall and cathedral-like: straight fir trunks, shafts of morning light through canopy gaps, cool blue shade giving way to warm patches, a winding dirt path with a rough wooden rail.

#### THE AWAKENING
- One simple trigger — a Sunrise Takeoff button — starts the spectacle: warmth spreads visibly across the clusters and butterflies lift in waves, thousands at a time, until the air is a slow orange blizzard catching the light.
- Flight is gentle, drifting, particle-like flutter — beautiful chaos, never precision aerobatics. Swirls follow the light shafts, eddy around trunks, and settle again in new clusters if left alone.
- Sound of the scene is visual: let wing-flicker density and light shimmer convey the famous rustle.

#### LIGHT THROUGH WINGS
- The signature image is backlit wings: translucent orange panes with dark leading, glowing when butterflies cross a sunbeam. Make subsurface glow the hero material effect.
- Keep the palette luminous: amber, fir-green, sky-blue gaps, warm dust motes. Bright throughout; no gloom.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom immediately, reset to the hero path view up into the laden boughs. Presets: under-canopy looking up, cluster close-up, light-shaft clearing, and a slow overhead drift above the treetops.
- Controls beyond the takeoff button: swirl density slider and a time-of-light slider (first ray to full morning). Nothing else. Tiny HUD: butterflies airborne count. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced butterflies with LOD (full wings near, flicker sprites far), clamped devicePixelRatio of 2, particle budgets that scale via a quality selector which thins distant fliers before touching near clusters or the light-shaft heroes. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>56. The Synchrony — Fireflies of the Smoky Mountains</strong></summary>

```text
Create an enchanted Three.js twilight scene of the synchronous fireflies of the Smoky Mountains: thousands of living lights blinking through a blue-hour Appalachian forest, gradually falling into one shared heartbeat of light that sweeps the hillside. Open directly in the deep-dusk forest with fireflies already rising and the first loose synchrony already forming — magical from the first frame, with a glowing periwinkle sky, warm cabin lights far below and mist threading the hollows; never pitch black. Do not create a title screen, menu, loading state, or an empty dark forest.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: emergent unison — chaos of sparks resolving into waves of simultaneous light, and a slider that lets the viewer dial the magic.

#### THE LIVING CONSTELLATION
- Thousands of instanced fireflies drifting on gentle wandering paths through ferns, trunks and rhododendron, each with a soft golden-green lantern glow that blooms and fades rather than blinking hard.
- Implement real synchronization behavior: each firefly carries its own clock that nudges toward its neighbors, so unison emerges and travels as luminous waves across the slope — light moving through the swarm like wind through grass.
- Between pulses the forest must stay alive: faint afterglows, a few out-of-step rebels, moths crossing the lights.

#### THE BLUE-HOUR FOREST
- Layered Appalachian staging: tall tulip poplars and hemlocks as soft silhouettes, fern carpets catching glow, a creek glinting, low mist bands, fireflies reflected where the water stills.
- The sky carries the brightness budget: deep periwinkle with the first stars and a fading apricot horizon; distant valley cabins and a winding trail of red lantern lights from quiet human watchers below.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero hillside view where synchrony waves read across the whole slope. Presets: trail-level among the lights, creek reflection view, canopy-gap view with stars, and a far ridge view of the entire blinking hillside.
- One simple control: a Synchrony slider from scattered chaos to perfect unison, changing the emergent waves in real time. Plus a swarm-density slider. Nothing else.
- Tiny HUD: synchrony percentage. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced glow sprites with shader-driven pulse clocks, restrained bloom tuned so lights glow without smearing, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, and a quality selector thinning far fireflies before near ones. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>57. Jellyfish Lake — Drifting Through the Golden Bloom</strong></summary>

```text
Create a serene, sun-drenched Three.js scene inside Jellyfish Lake in Palau: millions of golden jellyfish pulsing through turquoise water in their daily migration toward the light, so dense they form glowing amber clouds in every direction. Open directly inside the bloom, surrounded, with sunbeams shafting down and jellyfish already parting gently around the camera. Do not create a title screen, menu, loading state, or empty water.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: swimming through a galaxy of gold — overwhelming gentle multitude, with the simplest possible glide.

#### THE GOLDEN MULTITUDE
- Millions of instanced medusae at three readable scales: translucent amber bells with visible inner glow nearby, soft golden lanterns at mid distance, and warm particulate haze far off — the bloom must feel endless.
- Pulse animation is a simple, safe rhythm: bell contraction and relax with slight drift per pulse, desynchronized across the swarm so the whole cloud breathes. Trailing oral arms sway; nothing requires precision.
- The migration gives structure: a denser river of jellyfish flowing toward the brightest water, thinning toward the shadowed lake edges.

#### THE EMERALD LAKE
- The setting tells the famous story: an enclosed marine lake ringed by jungle — visible from underwater as overhanging green canopy and root tangles at the rim, sun flickering through leaves onto the surface ceiling.
- Water is the second hero: turquoise clarity, cathedral sunbeams, dust-mote plankton, the mirrored underside of the surface bending the jungle above.
- Quiet supporting life: small silver fry sheltering beneath bells, a lone snorkeler silhouette far off at the surface for scale and wonder.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- The one interaction is a gentle glide: the camera drifts continuously forward at swimmer pace and the mouse simply steers the drift — no buttons, no speed management, impossible to fail. Jellyfish part softly around the camera with a subtle touch-glow.
- Reset returns to the hero in-bloom position facing the densest sunlit river. Presets: surface-ceiling view among crowded bells, mid-lake galaxy view, lake-edge view back through the bloom toward the jungle rim, and a slow auto-drift tour toggle.
- Optional density slider; nothing else. No HUD beyond compact collapsible controls.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced bells with shader pulse variation and LOD, transmission-style translucency only on near jellyfish, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, and a quality selector that reduces far haze before near bells or sunbeams. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>58. The Night the Reef Blooms — Coral Spawning</strong></summary>

```text
Create a luminous Three.js underwater spectacle of mass coral spawning on the Great Barrier Reef: the one night a year the whole reef releases clouds of rose and pearl bundles that rise like inverted snow through moonlit water. Open directly mid-bloom — columns of spawn already lifting off the coral heads, fish already weaving through the drift. This must feel magical and bright, lit by a full moon, bioluminescent sparkle and the pale spawn itself; never a dark murky sea. Do not create a title screen, menu, loading state, or a barren reef.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: an entire ecosystem exhaling at once — upward snowfall at reef scale.

#### THE REEF AS A CITY
- Build a rich procedural reef-scape: plate, staghorn, brain and boulder corals in pastel lavenders, creams and pinks under moonlight, sea fans swaying, anemones breathing, giant clams with patterned mantles.
- Every coral type releases differently — synchronized puffs from some colonies, steady streams from others — so the bloom has texture and rhythm across the reef rather than one uniform particle field.

#### THE RISING SNOW
- The spawn is the hero system: dense drifting bundles with gentle buoyant rise, swirling in current eddies, thickening into a pink galaxy at the surface ceiling where moonlight pools.
- Add layered nightlife: small fish darting through to feed, a manta ray sweeping in graceful filter-feeding loops through the densest columns, a turtle crossing unhurried, plankton sparking with faint bioluminescent flecks when stirred.

#### MOONLIGHT WATER
- One strong moonbeam column and broad silver-blue ambience; the surface visible as a rippling mirror from below; palette of midnight blue, lavender, rose and pearl — luminous, dreamlike, clearly readable.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the hero reef-shoulder vista with rising columns against the moonbeam. Presets: coral-head macro at release, inside the densest column looking up, manta-following view, and surface-ceiling view where spawn gathers like stars.
- One simple trigger: Release the Bloom — fires the next synchronized wave reef-wide. Plus a current-drift slider that angles the rising snow. Nothing else.
- Tiny HUD: bloom intensity. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- GPU-friendly particle systems with LOD, instanced corals and fish, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, and a quality selector that thins far particles and far reef detail before touching the hero columns or the moonbeam. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>59. The Salmon Gauntlet — Brooks Falls in Full Run</strong></summary>

```text
Create a Three.js wildlife spectacle of Brooks Falls, Alaska, at the peak of the salmon run: a wide curtain of whitewater with salmon leaping in continuous silver arcs, and brown bears stationed at the lip like fishermen at their posts. Open directly mid-action — fish already in the air, a bear already braced at the famous lip spot, spray drifting in sunlight. Do not create a title screen, menu, loading state, or an empty river.

If you use Three.js, add an import map before the module script mapping "three" and "three/addons/" to the same pinned version, and import only via those names. Everything procedural; no external image assets or models.

Single idea: an upstream army against a waterfall — mass leaping fish, patient giants, and the comedy and drama of the catch.

#### THE LEAPING RIVER
- The salmon are a mass system: dozens airborne at any moment in varied ballistic arcs, hundreds visible as red-green shapes stacking in the pool below, surging, resting in eddies and launching again. The multitude carries the scene — individual fish stay simple, glinting and wet.
- Most leaps fail in believable ways: bouncing off the curtain, tumbling back in slapstick spins, clearing the lip in triumph just often enough to feel earned.

#### THE FISHERS
- Three or four bears with distinct posts and simple, sturdy behaviors: the lip-stander snapping at passing arcs, the snorkeler walking the pool with head underwater, the shallows-chaser making occasional splashy lunges, a mother with cubs watching from the bank.
- Catches are staged, readable moments — a snap, a flex, a fish held flapping — followed by a wade to the bank to eat, gulls converging instantly. Keep bear motion deliberate and weighty; no fine choreography demands.

#### THE ALASKAN STAGE
- Complete the place: tannin-green river, mossy spruce banks, drift logs, mist and a low rainbow standing in the spray, eagles overhead, the viewing platform with tiny distant watchers for scale.
- Bright overcast-to-sunny northern light; water sparkle everywhere; never gloomy.

#### SIMPLE EXPLORATION
- Orbit, pan, zoom; reset to the classic hero view square-on to the falls with the lip bear in frame. Presets: pool-level among the massing salmon, behind-the-lip view down the curtain, bank view past the mother and cubs, and a high river-bend overview.
- One simple control: a Run Intensity slider from steady trickle to peak frenzy (leap rate, pool density, catch frequency all scale). Nothing to steer or aim.
- Tiny HUD: leaps per minute and catches. Compact collapsible UI.

#### PERFORMANCE DISCIPLINE
- Instanced fish with pooled ballistic paths, particle spray budgeted, LOD on banks and trees, devicePixelRatio clamped to 2, quality selector thinning pool fish and spray before the leaping arcs or the bears. Smooth on a modern laptop.

<summary><strong>60. Billion-Piece Volcanic Island Birth</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most extreme real-time Three.js visualization of land being born from the ocean. The first frame must feel like a nature documentary, disaster film and scientific miracle colliding: black sea split open by incandescent lava fountains, a fresh crater ring rising from boiling water, white steam towers exploding hundreds of meters high, lightning inside the ash plume, research ships tossed by shock waves, helicopters circling through ash, pumice rafts spreading across the surface and a jagged newborn shoreline glowing red as waves vaporize against it. This must not be a generic volcano cone, a dark smoky background, a single lava blob, a static island or an educational diagram. It must be the physically overwhelming moment when the planet manufactures a new place.

Build a billion-piece impression through layered procedural systems: molten arcs, cooling black crust, tumbling lava bombs, cracked basalt shelves, glassy obsidian edges, red fissures, sulfur stains, ash flakes, steam vortices, rain hitting hot rock, wave foam, pumice pebbles, black sand fans, boat wakes, instrument buoys, rotor spray, glowing lava tubes and tiny scientists for scale. The island should visibly assemble from thousands of new surfaces: lava stacks, cools, fractures, collapses into surf, is buried by ash, is cut by waves, then slowly receives rain channels and the first green film of life. Use shader-driven lava cooling, instanced ejecta, GPU ash/sparks/steam/rain, wave meshes, transparent steam layers and procedural shoreline growth.

Make it a dynamic system rather than a pretty eruption. Provide a time scrub with violent phases: submarine bubbling, steam explosion, lava fountain, crater wall formation, black beach growth, rain cooling, landslide collapse, stabilized island and first-life epilogue. Camera modes: low boat view through spray, helicopter orbit, shoreline walk, top-down scientific survey, crater-rim danger view and a cinematic locked wide shot. Controls should visibly change eruption intensity, lava viscosity, sea swell, rain, wind, plume height, island age and camera mode. The default camera must show the peak impossible composition: lava meeting ocean, glowing new coast, research fleet, ash plume, lightning and moving waves all visible immediately.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles. Prioritize dynamic spectacle and concrete construction over explanatory UI. If a feature is mentioned, make it visible, moving or inspectable.

<summary><strong>61. Billion-Piece Shipwreck Salvage Resurrection</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most ambitious possible Three.js salvage spectacle: a fictional ocean liner the size of a city being resurrected from the abyss during a violent dawn storm. The first frame must be a jaw-dropping, fully active event: the torn bow has just exploded through the black surface, floodwater pours from hundreds of windows and deck openings, salvage cables strain like suspension bridges, giant crane ships lean under load, helicopters rake searchlights through rain, submersibles surface beside the hull, crew silhouettes brace on pitching decks, and the sea itself is being ripped into foam, mist, whirlpools and glittering spray. This must not be a static shipwreck, a simple underwater scene, a Titanic replay, a memorial tableau, a plain boat model or one crane beside a hull. It should feel like humans dragging a dead floating city back into daylight.

Push the perceived billion-piece detail to an unreasonable level while staying real-time: fractured hull plates, rivet fields, ripped promenade railings, dangling davits, twisted stairs, smashed bridge windows, barnacle gardens, seaweed sheets, rust blooms, torn funnels, buckled decks, cables, shackles, pulleys, buoy chains, flashing ROV lights, air bubbles, sediment clouds, foam sheets, oil-slick color, rain streaks, deck cranes, work boats, flare smoke, warning strobes and tiny crew scale cues. Use instancing, merged modules, LOD, impostor crews, shader-driven rust/wetness and GPU particles so every inch looks considered without creating literal impossible draw calls.

Make the whole scene move. The hull should rise centimeter by centimeter, cables should sway and vibrate, water should drain in heavy waterfalls, foam should wrap around pontoons, rain should streak across camera glass, floodlights should cut through mist, and loose debris should slide across decks as the ship tilts. Include a cinematic time scrub with phases: abyss discovery, cable attachment, deep ascent, surface breach, stabilization, tow line connection and final dawn tow toward a distant dry dock. Camera modes must be dramatic and useful: storm helicopter, crane operator, ROV/submersible, deck-level inspection, wide fleet overview and a locked cinematic rescue shot. Controls should visibly alter lift progress, sea state, storm intensity, floodlights, wreck cross-section visibility and camera mode. The default view must already be the maximum spectacle: bow breaching, full salvage fleet, storm sky, moving water, cables, people and impossible scale all in one frame.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles. Prioritize dynamic spectacle and concrete construction over explanatory UI. If a feature is mentioned, make it visible, moving or inspectable.

<summary><strong>62. Billion-Piece Living Ink-Oil World</strong></summary>

```text
Create the most visually luxurious Three.js ink-and-oil world possible: a real sheet of thick paper where black ink, iridescent oil and brush pressure physically generate a living 3D landscape. The first frame must be a macro spectacle: a giant brush has just dragged a stroke across fibrous paper, glossy black ink is spreading through capillaries, rainbow oil cells bloom and split on top, mountains rise from pigment ridges, tiny bridges and buildings emerge from calligraphic lines, droplets roll like boulders, and liquid color floods valleys in real time. This must not be a generic abstract shader, a flat ink drop, a screensaver swirl or a dark particle demo. It should feel like a painting becoming a world under the viewer's hands.

Push material detail aggressively: paper fibers, torn edges, absorbent halos, wet ridges, feathered ink, pigment granules, oil-film interference, bubbles, brush bristles, hairs dragging channels, glossy reflections, suspended dust, ink cliffs, paper valleys, miniature terrain, calligraphic roads, translucent color skins and tiny scale cues made from pigment, not generic fantasy props. Use shader-driven fluid motion, normal maps, displacement, reaction-diffusion-like oil patterns, instanced pigment grains, droplets, foam-like oil cells and procedural paper absorption. Black ink should feel heavy and alive; oil should feel luminous, unstable and slippery.

Make it an interactive material instrument. The user can drop ink, drag a brush, tilt the paper, adjust paper wetness, oil amount, pigment load, brush pressure and time. Streams should merge, branch, stain, bead, crawl uphill along fibers, dry into crust and reshape terrain. Camera modes: top-down painting, macro liquid-level, orbit through raised ink mountains, brush-follow, droplet chase and split-screen material cross-section. The default frame must already show a brushstroke world erupting from wet ink with rainbow oil moving across it. Keep it bright, tactile and hypnotic, with continuous visible motion from the first second.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles.

<summary><strong>63. Billion-Piece Space Elevator Dawn Climb</strong></summary>

```text
Create the definitive Three.js space elevator dawn climb: one clean impossible vertical journey rendered at maximum scale and detail. The opening frame must be enormous but instantly understandable: an equatorial ocean platform at sunrise, waves smashing against its legs, the elevator cable rising perfectly through cloud layers into near-black sky, a climber car already ascending, maintenance drones orbiting the cable, solar wings unfolding, service ships below, vapor trails crossing the horizon and the first hint of Earth curvature above the clouds. This must not be a generic sci-fi city, a space station diagram, a rocket launch or a starfield scene. It is a single impossible climb from sea to orbit.

Push the billion-piece detail through scale cues: braided cable strands, guide rails, climber windows, heat panels, docking clamps, solar arrays, inspection lights, frost forming at altitude, platform cranes, helipads, antenna fields, wave foam, ships, cloud shadows, lightning below, pressure haze, atmospheric color shifts, counterweight glints and tiny human interiors visible through glass. Use instanced cable modules, LOD platform machinery, atmospheric scattering, cloud impostors, shader frost and altitude-based lighting. The cable should remain visually sharp and monumental, never just a thin line.

Make the climb visibly dynamic. The climber should move up the cable, clouds should rush past, platform lights should shrink below, weather should transition, frost should creep over exterior panels, solar wings should flex, drones should inspect, and Earth curvature should emerge through altitude. Controls: climb speed, altitude scrub, cloud density, weather, time of day, cabin/exterior view, cable detail and camera mode. Camera modes: cabin glass looking down, exterior chase, platform-wide orbit, cloud-piercing cinematic shot, cable macro inspection and near-orbit view. The default must show platform, ocean, cable, climber, clouds and sunrise in one spectacular frame.

Absolute ambition bar: do not satisfy this prompt with a symbolic miniature, a sparse diorama, a single hero object, a mostly static scene, a flat shader demo or a clever but thin approximation. The output should feel like a flagship benchmark scene for a frontier web agent: immediate first-frame impact, visible motion in at least five independent systems, inspectable micro-detail at close range, strong silhouettes at wide range, meaningful camera modes, responsive controls with obvious visual consequences, and performance-conscious implementation using instancing, merged geometry, LOD, shader effects and GPU-friendly particles.
